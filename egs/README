This directory contains all the scripts necessary to reproduce some of the
experiments that we made.

Each experiment is located on a different folder and it should contain the
scripts (bash, lua, python, ...) necessary to reproduce the experiments
with a simple run.sh script.

The data MUST NOT be stored in the directory, but a README should explain
how to configure the run.sh to point to the place where the data is located.

Also, NO EXTERNAL SOFTWARE must be added to the repo. If external software
is needed (e.g. Kaldi, imgtxtenh, etc) it should be stated in the README.

See https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/tree/master/egs to have a clear idea
of how this directory should be used.
