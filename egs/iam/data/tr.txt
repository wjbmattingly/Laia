a01-000u-00 A MOVE to stop Mr. Gaitskell from
a01-000u-01 nominating any more Labour life Peers
a01-000u-02 is to be made at a meeting of Labour
a01-000u-03 M Ps tomorrow . Mr. Michael Foot has
a01-000u-04 put down a resolution on the subject
a01-000u-05 and he is to be backed by Mr. Will
a01-000u-06 Griffiths , M P for Manchester Exchange .
a01-003u-00 Though they may gather some Left-wing
a01-003u-01 support , a large majority of Labour
a01-003u-02 M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-
a01-003u-03 Griffiths resolution . Mr. Foot's line will
a01-003u-04 be that as Labour M Ps opposed the
a01-003u-05 Government Bill which brought life peers
a01-003u-06 into existence , they should not now put
a01-003u-07 forward nominees . He believes that the
a01-003u-08 House of Lords should be abolished and
a01-003u-09 that Labour should not take any steps
a01-003u-10 which would appear to " prop up " an out-
a01-007u-00 Since 1958 , 13 Labour life Peers and
a01-007u-01 Peeresses have been created . Most Labour
a01-007u-02 sentiment would still favour the abolition
a01-007u-03 of the House of Lords , but while it remains
a01-007u-04 Labour has to have an adequate number
a01-007u-05 of members . THE two rival African
a01-007u-06 Nationalist Parties of Northern Rhodesia
a01-007u-07 have agreed to get together to face
a01-007u-08 the challenge from Sir Roy Welensky ,
a01-007u-09 the Federal Premier .
a01-011u-00 Delegates from Mr. Kenneth Kaunda's
a01-011u-01 United National Independence Party
a01-011u-02 ( 280,000 members ) and Mr. Harry Nkumbula's
a01-011u-03 African National Congress ( 400,000 ) will
a01-011u-04 meet in London today to discuss a common
a01-011u-05 course of action . Sir Roy is violently
a01-011u-06 opposed to Africans getting an elected
a01-011u-07 majority in Northern Rhodesia , but the
a01-011u-08 Colonial Secretary , Mr. Iain Macleod ,
a01-011u-09 is insisting on a policy of change .
a01-014u-00 Sir Roy's United Federal Party is
a01-014u-01 boycotting the London talks on the
a01-014u-02 Protectorate's future . Said Mr. Nkumbula
a01-014u-03 last night : " We want to discuss what to
a01-014u-04 do if the British demonstrations . "
a01-014u-05 Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide , Mr.
a01-014u-06 Julius Greenfield , telephoned his chief
a01-014u-07 a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan
a01-020u-00 Mr. Macleod went on with the conference
a01-020u-01 at Lancaster House despite the crisis
a01-020u-02 which had blown up . He has now revealed
a01-020u-03 his full plans to the Africans and Liberals
a01-020u-04 attending . These plans do not give the
a01-020u-05 Africans the overall majority they are
a01-020u-06 seeking . African delegates are studying
a01-020u-07 them today . The conference will meet
a01-020u-08 to discuss the function of a proposed
a01-026u-00 MR. IAIN MACLEOD , the Colonial Secretary ,
a01-026u-01 denied in the Commons last night that
a01-026u-02 there have been secret negotiations on
a01-026u-03 Northern Rhodesia's future . The Northern
a01-026u-04 Rhodesia conference in London has been
a01-026u-05 boycotted by the two main settlers' parties -
a01-026u-06 the United Federal Party and the Dominion
a01-026u-07 Party . But representatives of Sir Roy
a01-026u-08 Welensky , Prime Minister of the Central
a01-026u-09 African Federation , went to Chequers at
a01-026u-10 the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan .
a01-030u-00 Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Federation .
a01-030u-01 Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end
a01-030u-02 meeting . But he told M Ps yesterday : " I
a01-030u-03 have no knowledge of secret negotiations . "
a01-030u-04 He said Britain had an obligation to consult
a01-030u-05 the Federal Government . But the final
a01-030u-06 decision remained with the British Government .
a01-030u-07 Mr. James Callaghan , Labour's Colonial
a01-030u-08 spokesman , said Sir Roy had no right to
a01-030u-09 delay progress in the talks by refusing
a01-030u-10 to sit round the conference table .
a01-043u-00 Informal talks at Lancaster House will
a01-043u-01 resume today . PRESIDENT KENNEDY today
a01-043u-02 defended the appointment of a Negro as
a01-043u-03 his Housing Minister . It has aroused strong
a01-043u-04 opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the
a01-043u-05 Deep South . The negro is Mr. Robert #
a01-043u-06 Weaver of New York . One of his tasks will
a01-043u-07 be to see there is no racial discrimination
a01-043u-08 in Government and State housing
a01-049u-00 Senator Allen Ellender , of Louisiana ,
a01-049u-01 sparked off the opposition by telling a
a01-049u-02 television audience it was " current
a01-049u-03 Washington gossip " that Weaver once had
a01-049u-04 Communist affiliations . The Senate Banking
a01-049u-05 Committee , which is headed by another
a01-049u-06 Southern Senator - Willis Robertson , of
a01-049u-07 Virginia - met today in closed session to
a01-049u-08 discuss Weaver's appointment . Senator
a01-049u-09 Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter
a01-049u-10 to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received
a01-049x-00 Senator Allen Ellender , of Louisiana ,
a01-049x-01 sparked off the opposition by telling a
a01-049x-02 television audience it was " current Washington
a01-049x-03 gossip " that Weaver once had Communist affilia-
a01-049x-04 tions . The Senate Banking Committee , which
a01-049x-05 is headed by another Southern Senator -
a01-049x-06 Willis Robertson , of Virginia - met today in
a01-049x-07 closed session to discuss Weaver's appointment .
a01-049x-08 Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a
a01-049x-09 letter to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several
a01-049x-10 complaints about Weaver's loyalty .
a01-053u-00 He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's
a01-053u-01 alleged association with organisations black-
a01-053u-02 listed by the Government . Immediately Mr.
a01-053u-03 Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator Robertson
a01-053u-04 saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
a01-053u-05 reported on Mr. Weaver . He believed
a01-053u-06 he would perform " outstanding service "
a01-053u-07 in his post . Senator Robertson's committee
a01-053u-08 has to pass Mr. Weaver's nomination before it
a01-053u-09 can be considered by the full Senate .
a01-058u-00 PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
a01-058u-01 over West Germany's cash offer to help
a01-058u-02 America's balance of payments position . He
a01-058u-03 said bluntly in Washington yesterday that
a01-058u-04 the offer - 357million - was not good enough .
a01-058u-05 And he indicated that his Government
a01-058u-06 would try to get Germany to pay more . He
a01-058u-07 did not mention personal talks with Dr.
a01-058u-08 Adenauer , the West German Chancellor .
a01-063u-00 But he said discussions " on a higher
a01-063u-01 level than in the past " might be useful .
a01-063u-02 The President will probably discuss the
a01-063u-03 problem with Dr. Brentano , the West German
a01-063u-04 Foreign Minister , who is due in Washington
a01-063u-05 next week . A big slice of Germany's " aid "
a01-063u-06 is the early payment of a 210million
a01-063u-07 debt to America . United States officials
a01-063u-08 quickly point out that this is money due
a01-068u-00 And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim
a01-068u-01 that they cannot pay more than 357million
a01-068u-02 without upsetting their own economy . The
a01-068u-03 Americans say Germany is having it too
a01-068u-04 good and is not paying for the past
a01-068u-05 or for the present . The Adenauer Government
a01-068u-06 flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower
a01-068u-07 Government to get them to pay a regular
a01-068u-08 sum towards the cost of keeping American
a01-072u-00 These support costs are a big drain on
a01-072u-01 America's dollar reserves . Dr. Adenauer's
a01-072u-02 answer is the once-and-for-all cash
a01-072u-03 offer of 357million . President Kennedy's
a01-072u-04 rejection of it is a painful blow to the
a01-072u-05 West German Government . It will now have
a01-072u-06 to pay more - and increase taxation to do
a01-072u-07 so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting
a01-072u-08 the new American administration .
a01-077u-00 And , since this is election year in West
a01-077u-01 Germany , Dr. Adenauer is in a tough spot .
a01-077u-02 Joyce Egginton cables : President Kennedy
a01-077u-03 at his Washington Press conference admitted
a01-077u-04 he did not know whether America was
a01-077u-05 lagging behind Russia in missile power .
a01-077u-06 He said he was waiting for his senior
a01-077u-07 military aides to come up with the answer
a01-082u-00 This surprising statement was a sharp about-
a01-082u-01 face from his warnings during the
a01-082u-02 Presidential election campaign . He claimed
a01-082u-03 slackness in the Eisenhower Administration
a01-082u-04 had caused America to lag behind Russia
a01-082u-05 in nuclear development . President Kennedy
a01-082u-06 did his best to avoid giving Pressmen
a01-082u-07 a direct answer . George Brown
a01-082u-08 CHILDREN TWO men who are poles apart
a01-082u-09 in personality last night dominated
a01-087u-00 Mr. Brown , passionate and warm-hearted ,
a01-087u-01 led Labour's attack on the higher health
a01-087u-02 charges . Mr. Powell , white-faced and
a01-087u-03 outwardly unemotional , replied with a
a01-087u-04 statistical statement - and ended by inciting
a01-087u-05 Labour M Ps to angry uproar . One dealt
a01-087u-06 with the human issue behind the Health
a01-087u-07 Service ; the other tried to show that the
a01-087u-08 balance-sheet must always come first .
a01-091u-00 The result of the vote was not in doubt .
a01-091u-01 For the Tories were massed in answer to
a01-091u-02 their whips to defeat a censure motion
a01-091u-03 on the Government for " undermining the
a01-091u-04 Health Service " and placing heavy burdens
a01-091u-05 on those least able to bear them . Mr.
a01-091u-06 Brown declared that the policy under
a01-091u-07 censure was monstrous . It had offended
a01-091u-08 many people far beyond the ranks of
a01-096u-00 The Press , many doctors and public were
a01-096u-01 denouncing the proposals . He quoted from
a01-096u-02 this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received :
a01-096u-03 " My background is a doctor of 68 , who
a01-096u-04 has practised medicine for 43 years , chiefly
a01-096u-05 as a panel doctor . " I am a lifelong
a01-096u-06 Conservative . I am horrified and amazed
a01-096u-07 by my party's proposal to prostitute the
a01-096u-08 whole principle of the State service and
a01-096u-09 to render that service a hardship to poor
a01-102u-00 " After a lifetime of helping others and
a01-102u-01 healing the sick , my considered opinion is that
a01-102u-02 anybody supporting the increased charges is a
a01-102u-03 wicked , old - . " Mr. Brown went on : " We
a01-102u-04 are dealing with a noble edifice which
a01-102u-05 needs an imaginative architect to improve
a01-102u-06 it , but it has got a quantity surveyor . We
a01-102u-07 have descended from the real problems to
a01-102u-08 fiddling about with bills of cost .
a01-107u-00 " We believe that a comprehensive medical
a01-107u-01 service , free to the patient at the point
a01-107u-02 of need and with one standard for all
a01-107u-03 sick people , is good and attainable .
a01-107u-04 " We remain for it . But the Tories
a01-107u-05 never were . " Interrupted by angry Tories ,
a01-107u-06 Mr. Brown retorted : " The jackals bay
a01-107u-07 when there is nothing better they can do . "
a01-113u-00 He told them that their conception of social
a01-113u-01 services was wholly different - fundamentally
a01-113u-02 different from that of Labour . They would
a01-113u-03 provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
a01-113u-04 wretched - but it would not be too comfortable
a01-113u-05 nor too easy to get . Answering jeers that
a01-113u-06 it was Labour which first put a ceiling
a01-113u-07 on health spending and started charges , Mr.
a01-113u-08 Brown reminded the hostile Government benches
a01-113u-09 that was done in 1950 because of the financial
a01-113u-10 strain of the Korean war .
a01-117u-00 In fact , the Tories made it worse now
a01-117u-01 for the sick and needy than Labour had
a01-117u-02 to make it in 1950 . And as a percentage
a01-117u-03 of social service expenditure , health had
a01-117u-04 fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. Then
a01-117u-05 Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to
a01-117u-06 the unsmiling Mr. Powell . He demanded
a01-117u-07 that instead of taking it out of the
a01-117u-08 patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless
a01-117u-09 action against the drug making industry , #
a01-117u-10 whose profits had risen by up to 400 per
a01-122u-00 " Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out
a01-122u-01 of mothers , children and sick people than
a01-122u-02 to take on this vast industry , " Mr.
a01-122u-03 Brown commented icily . " Let us have a
a01-122u-04 full inquiry into the cost of drugs and
a01-122u-05 the pharmaceutical industry . " The health
a01-122u-06 of children today owed much to the welfare
a01-122u-07 food scheme . It was maintained during
a01-122u-08 the war . Now in conditions of Tory
a01-122u-09 affluence it seemed it could not be
a01-128u-00 When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps
a01-128u-01 cheered for a full minute - and even his
a01-128u-02 bitterest opponents on defence joined in .
a01-128u-03 Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving
a01-128u-04 details of plans for improving the hospital
a01-128u-05 service , on which indeed the Government is
a01-128u-06 making progress . His basic defence of the
a01-128u-07 Health Service cuts was that " even after
a01-128u-08 the proposed changes the net cost of the
a01-128u-09 service to the Exchequer will have increased
a01-128u-10 over three years by 20 per cent.
a01-132u-00 " That cannot continue without either development
a01-132u-01 being limited or an adjustment being made
a01-132u-02 in financing . " The Government decided to
a01-132u-03 adjust the financing - which Mr. Powell
a01-132u-04 claimed was underpinning - not undermining -
a01-132u-05 the service . Answering the attack on
a01-132u-06 " economic charges " for welfare foods , Mr.
a01-132u-07 Powell said that all these foods would
a01-132u-08 still be free in families receiving regular
a01-132u-09 National Assistance grants .
a01-132x-00 " That cannot continue without either development
a01-132x-01 being limited or an adjustment being made
a01-132x-02 in financing . " The Government decided to adjust
a01-132x-03 the financing - which Mr. Powell claimed was
a01-132x-04 underpinning - not undermining - the service .
a01-132x-05 Answering the attack on " economic charges "
a01-132x-06 for welfare , Mr. Powell said that all these
a01-132x-07 foods would still be free in families receiving
a01-132x-08 regular National Assistance grants .
a03-050-00 On the other hand , Mr. Pearson excels
a03-050-01 in meeting people informally , but many
a03-050-02 still regard him " as some sort of cross
a03-050-03 between an egghead and a missionary " .
a03-050-04 His party advisers are now trying to
a03-050-05 correct that image . The bow tie has
a03-050-06 gone ; he is having lessons on
a03-050-07 television techniques and is being coached
a03-071-00 But , at the same time , there is reason to
a03-071-01 believe that the Federal Government is not
a03-071-02 convinced , on the basis of the information
a03-071-03 it has so far , that such a project would
a03-071-04 be justified from a scientific point of view ;
a03-071-05 and not merely constitute a " prestige "
a03-071-06 satellite , duplicating to some extent American
a03-071-07 efforts , as Die Welt suggests today in
a03-073-00 On the specific question of the use of Blue
a03-073-01 Streak , Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
a03-073-02 easier . He can point out that this is the
a03-073-03 only rocket and launcher in Europe to
a03-073-04 have reached a sufficient stage of development
a03-073-05 for adaptation as the first stage in
a03-073-06 putting a heavy satellite into outer space .
a03-073-07 There has also been some talk of adopting another
a03-073-08 British rocket , Black Knight , for the second
a03-073-09 stage , but the French have one of their
a03-073-10 own called Veronique which they would
a03-080-00 The Foreign Ministry spokesman added
a03-080-01 today , however , that the Brussels Treaty
a03-080-02 was irrelevant , because research on the
a03-080-03 various rocket stages had already been
a03-080-04 concluded , and only cooperation on the type
a03-080-05 of capsule was involved . A lesser obstacle
a03-080-06 to German participation is the absence of
a03-080-07 any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
a03-080-08 for it - and therefore of any budget
a03-080-09 under which funds could be appropriated .
a03-089-00 This is expected eventually to replace the
a03-089-01 Fiat G-91 , and the F 104 Starfighter ,
a03-089-02 the backbone of the German Air
a05-000-00 THE next White Paper on defence , to
a05-000-01 be published in March , is likely to
a05-000-02 contain a five-year plan for the three
a05-000-03 Services . Its aim will be to produce superbly
a05-000-04 equipped , all-Regular forces of
a05-000-05 about 400,000 men . The three Services
a05-000-06 would be " integrated " to a greater
a05-000-07 extent than ever before .
a05-013-00 The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
a05-013-01 approval . Mr. Watkinson remains con-
a05-013-02 vinced that the policy initiated in
a05-013-03 1957 , in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister
a05-013-04 of Defence , is still correct . This was to
a05-013-05 return to the tradition of all-Regular
a05-013-06 voluntary forces , with the last National
a05-013-07 Serviceman out of uniform by the end
a05-017-00 The Minister regards the recent trend
a05-017-01 of recruiting figures as encouraging .
a05-017-02 He is confident the aim can be achieved .
a05-017-03 While the possibility of an eventual return
a05-017-04 to National Service in some form
a05-017-05 cannot be entirely discounted , he does
a05-017-06 not agree that the point has been reached
a05-017-07 where this need even be considered . If
a05-017-08 National Service is ever resorted to ,
a05-017-09 engagement would probably have to be for
a05-022-00 It is thought this would be the minimum
a05-022-01 necessary for the extended training modern
a05-022-02 arms require and to enable each man to
a05-022-03 serve at least a year overseas . There is
a05-022-04 no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
a05-022-05 is at odds with the Service chiefs over
a05-022-06 the decision to dispense with National
a05-022-07 Service , or over any other aspect of
a05-025-00 Criticisms about Army manpower appear
a05-025-01 to have come mainly from retired officers
a05-025-02 who have held high positions but
a05-025-03 are out of touch with the existing situation .
a05-025-04 Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
a05-025-05 from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir
a05-025-06 Francis Festing , who believes completely
a05-025-07 in the principle of an all-Regular army .
a05-025-08 Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed
a05-025-09 Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr.
a05-029-00 Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
a05-029-01 as from Nov. 1 . The hand-over , due in
a05-029-02 September , was delayed because of the
a05-029-03 Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
a05-029-04 felt the change would be unwise at a
a05-029-05 moment # when attention had to be
a05-029-06 concentrated on possible need for important
a05-029-07 military operations . For this reason Sir
a05-029-08 Francis stayed on , and # sacrificed
a05-039-00 There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing
a05-039-01 towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd ,
a05-039-02 the Prime Minister . This implies the dis-
a05-039-03 appearance of the Progressive party from
a05-039-04 the House . Early results in yesterday's
a05-039-05 general election showed Nationalists being
a05-039-06 returned in their strongholds , like Bloem-
a05-039-07 fontein and the Transvaal , with slightly
a05-039-08 increased majorities . In the Cape , the
a05-039-09 veteran United Party politician , Mr. Harry
a05-039-10 Lawrence , standing as a Progressive , was
a05-044-00 The defeat of the leader of the
a05-044-01 Progressive party , Dr. Steytler , in Port
a05-044-02 Elizabeth South , announced immediately
a05-044-03 afterwards by the United party candidate ,
a05-044-04 Mr. Plewman , left the Progressives deprived
a05-044-05 of both their chief figures . Dr. Verwoerd and
a05-044-06 the Leader of the Opposition , Sir de
a05-044-07 Villiers Graaff , have been returned unopposed .
a05-044-08 The contests were for 86 seats as 70
a05-044-09 Nationalists and 20 United party candi-
a05-048-00 Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
a05-048-01 evident that voters were bored by the
a05-048-02 Government's frequent appeals to the electorate .
a05-048-03 The election was the fourth in four years .
a05-048-04 In most constituencies it may go down as
a05-048-05 the most apathetic in the country's history .
a05-048-06 THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
a05-048-07 last night that he had considered early
a05-048-08 in the Parliamentary recess whether to
a05-048-09 mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
a05-048-10 British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing .
a05-053-00 He decided that it would be a great error
a05-053-01 to do so and to recall Parliament . But
a05-053-02 there would be no hesitation in mobilising
a05-053-03 if a further deterioration in the situation
a05-053-04 warranted such a step . It would have to be
a05-053-05 accompanied by other measures of a military ,
a05-053-06 economic and political kind . Mr. Macmillan ,
a05-053-07 who was winding up the foreign affairs
a05-053-08 debate , said the Government could not
a05-053-09 be party to accepting as a matter of
a05-053-10 principle the imposed division of Germany .
a05-058-00 " We must not be rattled into surrender ,
a05-058-01 but we must not - and I am not - be
a05-058-02 afraid of negotiation . " Mr. Godber ,
a05-058-03 Minister of State , Foreign Office , said
a05-058-04 earlier that the Government had asked
a05-058-05 the Medical Research Council to reassess
a05-058-06 the fall-out position in view of the Russian
a05-058-07 tests . The Council's findings would be
a05-062-00 With a vigour and authority which delighted
a05-062-01 old Parliamentary friends and foes alike ,
a05-062-02 the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony
a05-062-03 Eden , in his maiden speech in the House
a05-062-04 of Lords last night , gave a warning
a05-062-05 that # appeasement over Berlin could
a05-062-06 only lead to war . To stand firm , he
a05-062-07 declared , was not to invite war , but
a05-062-08 the surest way to avert it .
a05-069-00 It was the end of a rather curious
a05-069-01 speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
a05-069-02 the two-day debate on foreign affairs .
a05-069-03 He began in a low , almost chatty mono-
a05-069-04 tone , and his voice never rose to any
a05-069-05 accent of urgency . He passed in rapid
a05-069-06 review the United Nations Secretariat ;
a05-069-07 nuclear tests ; the canard about British
a05-069-08 interference with the United Nations
a05-069-09 in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East
a05-073-00 He spent most of his short half-hour on
a05-073-01 Berlin . He deplored the possibility of
a05-073-02 some " new myth " about betrayal of Germany
a05-073-03 by the Allies . " We do not , " he said , " really
a05-073-04 know what the Russians want . " But he was
a05-073-05 certain that they wanted to establish a
a05-073-06 final and irrevocable division of Germany .
a05-073-07 Britain could not be a party to an imposed
a05-073-08 division . But negotiation , as the debate had
a05-073-09 shown , could be undertaken on a variety
a05-080-00 Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
a05-080-01 ately refrained during the summer from
a05-080-02 recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
a05-080-03 by proclamation , such as would be
a05-080-04 necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
a05-080-05 on to a fully active footing . That
a05-080-06 would have created a thoroughly unde-
a05-080-07 sirable atmosphere of panic . He thought
a05-080-08 that the situation was rather more
a05-084-00 The Russians now realised its seriousness . The
a05-084-01 French doubts were more about procedure
a05-084-02 than about substance . The Prime Minister's
a05-084-03 attitude of studied calm brought down the
a05-084-04 temperature of the debate , which never
a05-084-05 at any time rose to fever pitch , to a
a05-084-06 remarkable degree of sub-normality .
a05-084-07 Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
a05-084-08 of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening
a05-084-09 in the Peers' Gallery .
a05-089-00 The early speakers in the debate each
a05-089-01 severely rated the speech of his predecessor .
a05-089-02 These strictures were all too well justified .
a05-089-03 We started with the plaintive wailings
a05-089-04 of Mr. Healey , " Shadow " Foreign Secretary ,
a05-089-05 described by Mr. Godber , Minister of
a05-089-06 State , Foreign Office , as " pedantic and
a05-089-07 obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure
a05-089-08 on the Congo . " In turn , Mr. Godber was
a05-089-09 censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour
a05-089-10 Defence Minister , for having read the
a05-094-00 The trouble about such debates is that
a05-094-01 they range too widely . They remind one of
a05-094-02 the Rugby match in " Tom Brown's Schooldays , "
a05-094-03 in which all the boys were welcome to
a05-094-04 take part , and only those who " really meant
a05-094-05 business " removed their jackets . Not many
a05-094-06 metaphorical braces were visible in the
a05-094-07 early stages of to-night's debate . Mr.
a05-094-08 Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
a05-094-09 golf-course Press conference , which he
a05-094-10 described as " a display of flabby and
a05-099-00 A reference to the reunification of Germany
a05-099-01 brought a bark of " Start another war ! "
a05-099-02 from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) .
a05-099-03 Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
a05-099-04 theme of limitation of armaments in Europe .
a05-099-05 This could , he suggested , be linked with
a05-099-06 prohibition of the production of atomic
a05-099-07 weapons in any part of Europe . Inspection
a05-099-08 and control would be much easier to
a05-099-09 establish in these territories .
a05-104-00 Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
a05-104-01 using double standards . Ministers had
a05-104-02 rebuked the unaligned nations for not
a05-104-03 condemning the new Russian tests , but
a05-104-04 they themselves had no condemnation for
a05-104-05 events in Angola or Algeria . It was not for
a05-104-06 the Government , said Mr. Healey , to
a05-104-07 take up moral attitudes , " especially when
a05-104-08 the temple of their religion is the
a05-108-00 This puzzled such students of comparative
a05-108-01 religion as had failed to detect this cult .
a05-108-02 But Mr. Healey had a partial and
a05-108-03 limited success . He rallied behind him
a05-108-04 the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last
a05-108-05 night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . Mr.
a05-108-06 Godber's performance merited all the mild
a05-108-07 scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell .
a05-113-00 True , he did tell the House that the
a05-113-01 Government had asked the Medical Research
a05-113-02 Council to reassess the fall-out position in
a05-113-03 view of the Russian tests , and said that
a05-113-04 the council's findings would be published .
a05-113-05 He was not so happy in his defence of
a05-113-06 the Government's failure to condemn
a05-113-07 France for her nuclear tests in the
a05-113-08 Sahara on the grounds that they were
a05-116-00 This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
a05-116-01 and her illegitimate baby . For the most
a05-116-02 part , Mr. Godber muttered his way
a05-116-03 through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office
a05-116-04 brief . He resembles the elephant seal , an
a05-116-05 # otherwise endearing creature whose
a05-116-06 articulation is limited , we are told , to a
a05-116-07 series of heavy sighs . Sir Lynn Ungoed-

a05-121-03 atmosphere as a crime against humanity . "

a05-125-01 bomb demonstrators thronged the Central
a05-125-02 Lobby of the House of Commons last
a05-125-03 night and formed a queue stretching
a05-125-04 for more than 200 yards outside

a01-000x-01 any more Labour life Peers is to be made at a
a01-000x-02 meeting of Labour 0M Ps tomorrow . Mr. Michael
a01-000x-03 Foot has put down a resolution on the subject
a01-000x-04 and he is to be backed by Mr. Will Griffiths ,
a01-000x-05 0M P for Manchester Exchange .
a01-072x-00 These support costs are a big drain on America's
a01-072x-01 dollar reserves . Dr. Adenauer's answer is the
a01-072x-02 once-and-for-all cash offer of 357million . President
a01-072x-03 Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the
a01-072x-04 West German Government . It will now have to pay
a01-072x-05 more - and increase taxation to do so - or
a01-072x-06 run the obvious risks in upsetting the new
a01-003-00 Though they may gather some Left-wing support , a
a01-003-01 large majority of Labour M Ps are likely to
a01-003-02 turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution . Mr.
a01-003-03 Foot's line will be that as Labour M Ps
a01-003-04 opposed the Government Bill which brought
a01-003-05 life peers into existence , they should not
a01-003-06 now put forward nominees . He believes
a01-003-07 that the House of Lords should be abolished
a01-003-08 and that Labour should not take any steps
a01-003-09 which would appear to " prop up " an out-dated

a01-030-05 Government . Mr. James Callaghan , Labour's Colonial spokesman ,
a01-030-06 said Sir Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks by

a01-043x-04 senators of the Deep South . The negro is Mr.

a01-049-00 Senator Allen Ellender of Louisiana sparked
a01-049-01 off the opposition by telling a television
a01-049-02 audience it was " current Washington gossip "
a01-049-03 that Weaver once had Communist affiliations .
a01-049-04 The Senate Banking Committee , which is headed
a01-049-05 by another Southern Senator - Willis Robertson ,
a01-049-06 of Virginia - met today in closed session
a01-049-07 to discuss Weaver's appointment . Senator
a01-049-08 Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter
a01-049-09 to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several
a01-049-10 complaints about Weaver's loyalty .
a01-053-00 He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's
a01-053-01 alleged association with organisations black-
a01-053-02 listed by the Government . Immediately
a01-053-03 Mr. Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator
a01-053-04 Robertson saying the Federal Bureau of In-
a01-053-05 vestigation had reported on Mr. Weaver .
a01-053-06 He believed he would perform " outstanding
a01-053-07 service " in his post . Senator Robertson's
a01-053-08 committee has to pass Mr. Weaver's
a01-053-09 nomination before it can be con-
a01-053-10 # sidered by the full Senate .
a01-058-00 PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
a01-058-01 over West Germany's cash offer to help
a01-058-02 America's balance of payments position .
a01-058-03 He said bluntly in Washington yester-
a01-058-04 day that the offer - 357million - was
a01-058-05 not good enough . And he indicated
a01-058-06 that his Government would try to get
a01-058-07 Germany to pay more . He did not
a01-058-08 mention personal talks with Dr.
a01-058-09 Adenauer , the West German Chancellor .
a01-063-00 But he said discussions " on a higher
a01-063-01 level than in the past " might be
a01-063-02 useful . The President will probably
a01-063-03 discuss the problem with Dr. Brentano ,
a01-063-04 the West German Foreign Minister , who is
a01-063-05 due in Washington next week . A big
a01-063-06 slice of Germany's " aid " # is the early
a01-063-07 payment of a 210million debt to America .
a01-063-08 United States officials quickly point out
a01-063-09 that this is money due to America
a01-053x-00 He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's alleged
a01-053x-01 association with organisations black-listed by the
a01-053x-02 Government . Immediately Mr. Kennedy rushed a letter
a01-053x-03 to Senator Robertson saying the Federal Bureau
a01-053x-04 of Investigation had reported on Mr. Weaver .
a01-053x-05 He believed he would perform " outstanding
a01-053x-06 service " in his post . Senator Robertson's
a01-053x-07 committee has to pass Mr. Weaver's
a01-053x-08 nomination before it can be considered by the
a01-058x-00 PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get
a01-058x-01 tough over West Germany's cash offer to
a01-058x-02 help America's balance of payments position
a01-058x-03 He said bluntly in Washington yesterday
a01-058x-04 that the offer - 357million - was not good
a01-058x-05 enough . And he indicated that his
a01-058x-06 Government would try to get Germany to
a01-058x-07 pay more . He did not mention personal
a01-058x-08 talks with Dr. Adenauer , the West
a01-063x-00 But he said discussions " on a higher
a01-063x-01 level than in the past " might be useful .
a01-063x-02 The President will probably discuss the
a01-063x-03 problem with Dr. Brentano , the West
a01-063x-04 German Foreign Minister , who is due in
a01-063x-05 Washington next week . A big slice of
a01-063x-06 Germany's " aid " is the early payment
a01-063x-07 of a 210million debt to America . United
a01-063x-08 States officials quickly point out that
a01-063x-09 this is money due to America anyway .
a01-077-00 And , since this is election year in West
a01-077-01 Germany , Dr. Adenauer is in a tough
a01-077-02 spot . Joyce Egginton cables : President
a01-077-03 Kennedy at his Washington Press con-
a01-077-04 ference admitted he did not know
a01-077-05 whether America was lagging behind
a01-077-06 Russia in missile power . He said he
a01-077-07 was waiting for his senior military
a01-077-08 aides to come up with the answer on
a01-091-00 The result of the vote was not in
a01-091-01 doubt . For the Tories were massed
a01-091-02 in answer to their whips to defeat a
a01-091-03 censure motion on the Government for
a01-091-04 " undermining the Health Service " and
a01-091-05 placing heavy burdens on those least
a01-091-06 able to bear them . Mr. Brown
a01-091-07 declared that the policy under censure
a01-091-08 was monstrous . It had offended many
a01-091-09 people far beyond the ranks of Labour
a01-102-00 " After a lifetime of helping others and
a01-102-01 healing the sick , my considered
a01-102-02 opinion is that anybody supporting
a01-102-03 the increased charges is a wicked ,
a01-102-04 old - . " Mr. Brown went on : " We
a01-102-05 are dealing with a noble edifice which
a01-102-06 needs an imaginative architect to
a01-102-07 improve it , but it has got a
a01-102-08 quantity surveyor . We have descended
a01-102-09 from the real problems to fiddling about
a01-087-00 Mr. Brown , passionate and warm-hearted , led
a01-087-01 Labour's attack on the higher health
a01-087-02 charges . Mr. Powell , white-faced and outwardly
a01-087-03 unemotional , replied with a statistical state-
a01-087-04 ment - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps
a01-087-05 to angry uproar . One dealt with the human
a01-087-06 issue behind the Health Service ; the other
a01-087-07 tried to show that the balance-sheet must
b01-057-00 A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine , paid
b01-057-01 for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament .
b01-057-02 Those who lend their names to this kind of
b01-057-03 advertisement are worthy people , a little innocent
b01-057-04 of politics , perhaps , or carried away by the
b01-057-05 idea that moral regeneration would solve
b01-057-06 all our problems . So it would . While we are
b01-057-07 waiting for the millenium , however , most of us
b01-057-08 would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
b01-057-09 instruments of democracy , such as trade unions
b01-057-10 and our local and national Parliaments .
b01-062-00 Should the Herald publish such advertisements ?
b01-062-01 This is a difficult question . It would obviously
b01-062-02 be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
b01-062-03 which we disagree . When an advertisement
b01-062-04 contains statements whose factual truth is
b01-062-05 doubtful , or where the total content would be
b01-062-06 deeply repugnant to our readers , it is right to
b01-062-07 exercise editorial discretion . The MRA
b01-062-08 advertisement falls into neither category , though
b01-062-09 many readers will dislike it .
a01-107-00 We believe that a comprehensive medical service , free to the patient
a01-107-01 at the point of need and with one standard for all sick
a01-107-02 people , is good and attainable . " We remain for it . But the Tories
a01-107-03 never were . " Interrupted by angry Tories , Mr. Brown retorted :
a01-107-04 " The jackals bay when there is nothing better they can do . "
a01-113-00 He told them that their conception of social services was wholly
a01-113-01 different - fundamentally different from that of Labour . They
a01-113-02 would provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
a01-113-03 wretched - but it would not be too comfortable nor too easy to
a01-113-04 get . Answering jeers that it was Labour which first put a
a01-113-05 ceiling on health spending and started charges , Mr. Brown
a01-113-06 reminded the hostile Government benches that was
a01-113-07 done in 1950 because of the financial strain of
a01-117-00 In fact , the Tories made it worse now for the sick and
a01-117-01 needy than Labour had to make it in 1950 . And
a01-117-02 as a percentage of social service expenditure ,
a01-117-03 health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
a01-117-04 Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the
a01-117-05 unsmiling Mr. Powell . He demanded that instead
a01-117-06 of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
a01-117-07 take ruthless action against the drug making
a01-117-08 industry , whose profits had risen by up to 400
a01-117-09 per cent. in the last eight years .
a01-122-00 " Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out of mothers ,
a01-122-01 children and sick people than to take on this vast
a01-122-02 industry , " Mr. Brown commented icily . " Let us have a
a01-122-03 full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the pharmaceutical
a01-122-04 industry . " The health of children today owed much
a01-122-05 to the welfare food scheme . It was maintained
a01-122-06 during the war . Now in conditions of Tory
a01-122-07 affluence it seemed it could not be carried on .
a01-128-00 When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps cheered for
a01-128-01 a full minute - and even his bitterest opponents
a01-128-02 on defence joined in . Mr. Powell devoted half his speech
a01-128-03 to giving details of plans for improving the hospital service ,
a01-128-04 on which indeed the Government is making progress .
a01-128-05 His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that
a01-128-06 " even after the proposed changes the net cost of the
a01-128-07 service to the Exchequer will have increased over
a01-132-00 " That cannot continue without either
a01-132-01 development being limited or an
a01-132-02 adjustment being made in financing . "
a01-132-03 The Government decided to adjust
a01-132-04 the financing - which Mr. Powell
a01-132-05 claimed was underpinning - not
a01-132-06 undermining - the service . Answering the
a01-132-07 attack on " economic charges " for welfare
a01-132-08 foods , Mr. Powell said that all these
a01-132-09 foods would still be free in families
a01-132-10 receiving regular National Assistance
a02-000-00 MR. Macmillan has picked a strong " brains trust "
a02-000-01 team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market .
a02-000-02 And he has abandoned plans to visit President de
a02-000-03 Gaulle this month to smooth the way . General
a02-000-04 de Gaulle's official welcome last week
a02-000-05 to Britain's moves towards the Six was
a02-000-06 taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall ,
a02-000-07 but no more than that .
a02-004-00 So the idea of personal mission by
a02-004-01 the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped
a02-004-02 Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a
a02-004-03 hand-picked team under the leadership of
a02-004-04 Sir Pierson Dixon , Britain's Ambassador to
a02-004-05 France , to back Mr. Edward Heath , Lord
a02-004-06 Privy Seal , who is charged with the conduct
a02-004-07 of negotiations with the Six . At the same
a02-004-08 time the Prime Minister has offered
a02-004-09 Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to
a02-004-10 safeguard their interests
a02-008-00 Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys ,
a02-008-01 Commonwealth Relations Secretary , that they wish to be kept
a02-008-02 in touch in London . Three of them - Canada , Australia ,
a02-008-03 New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening
a02-008-04 meeting in London on Monday . Once the Common
a02-008-05 Market's Council of Ministers draws up the procedure
a02-008-06 for negotiations in a fortnight's time , these Commonwealth
a02-008-07 countries can arrange for observers to advise the British
a02-012-00 The team is composed of experienced
a02-012-01 negotiators in several fields . Sir Pier-
a02-012-02 son Dixon has a wide reputation as
a02-012-03 a skilful backstage negotiator since
a02-012-04 his days as Britain's chief UN dele-
a02-012-05 gate . Second in command is Mr.
a02-012-06 Eric Roll , 53-year-old Deputy Secre-
a02-012-07 tary at the Ministry of Agriculture ,
a02-012-08 Food , and Fisheries . The Foreign Office
a02-012-09 is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay
a02-017-00 Other leading members are : Sir Henry Lintott from
a02-017-01 the Commonwealth Relations Office , Sir William
a02-017-02 Corell-Barnes ( Colonial Office ) , Mr. G. R. Bell
a02-017-03 ( Treasury ) , and Mr. G. H. Andrew ( Board of Trade ) .
a02-017-04 They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when
a02-017-05 he goes to Brussels , headquarters of the Common
a02-017-06 Market Commission , or wherever the Six decide
a02-017-07 negotiations should be held .
a02-020-00 Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a
a02-020-01 meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville , French
a02-020-02 Foreign Minister , and Mr. Heath . MR. Selwyn Lloyd -
a02-020-03 a man with troubles enough back home - seems
a02-020-04 fated to fly into trouble abroad . Last year it was
a02-020-05 the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO
a02-024-00 Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
a02-024-01 Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
a02-024-02 monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
a02-024-03 first to be held in Africa . Only a few hours af-
a02-024-04 ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
a02-024-05 at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants
a02-024-06 demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
a02-027-00 The stores had been hit by the same strike wave
a02-027-01 that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past
a02-027-02 week . Root of the discontent : The austerity Budget ,
a02-027-03 including a compulsory savings scheme which the
a02-027-04 Ghana Government introduced in July . Ghana's strong
a02-027-05 man is not here to face the storm . President Nkrumah ,
a02-027-06 having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference
a02-027-07 in Belgrade , has resumed his holiday on the Black
a02-027-08 Sea and no one here professes to know when he
a02-032-00 But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
a02-032-01 not let him down . The strong arm of authority has
a02-032-02 been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
a02-032-03 to tell . Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : " The welfare
a02-032-04 of the people is the supreme law " ) reports : " The
a02-032-05 Government has been urged to take immediate ac-
a02-032-06 tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers . "
a02-037-00 The urge came from a conference of activists of
a02-037-01 Nkrumah's Convention Party " after powerful addresses
a02-037-02 by Comrades Krobo Edusei , Tawia Adamafio , " and
a02-037-03 others . Strong deeds followed strong words . In Takoradi
a02-037-04 a " limited state of emergency " was declared , giving
a02-037-05 the Government adequate power to maintain all
a02-037-06 essential services and ensure food supplies . Thus it
a02-037-07 becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
a02-037-08 for anyone who " publishes a report likely to cause
a02-037-09 alarm or prejudicial to public safety . "
a02-042-00 And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed
a02-042-01 on anyone convicted of sabotage . These stern measures
a02-042-02 had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
a02-042-03 strikers gave in , but in Takoradi , the chief storm centre ,
a02-042-04 they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400
a02-042-05 police and 16 armoured cars . And how did the
a02-042-06 Government react when the strikers demonstrated in
a02-090-00 " It is true he made a point of again being absent
a02-090-01 from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have
a02-090-02 indulged in such violence . " But Sir Roy pointed out
a02-090-03 that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that
a02-090-04 if UNIP did not get its way what would happen
a02-090-05 would make the Mau Mau in Kenya " seem like a
a02-093-00 JOHN DICKIE writes : Mr. Macmillan gave top
a02-093-01 priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
a02-093-02 return from Scotland yesterday . He summoned Mr.
a02-093-03 Iain Macleod , Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Duncan Sandys ,
a02-093-04 Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks
a02-093-05 at Admiralty House . A statement is expected today
a02-093-06 to hold the door open for modifications to the
a02-093-07 new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
a02-098-00 Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
a02-098-01 problem . Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a
a02-098-02 strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
a02-098-03 suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
a02-098-04 African nationalists . Mr. Macleod has ample evidence
a02-098-05 from talks with Sir John Moffat , Northern Rhodesian
a02-098-06 Liberal leader , and Mr. Kaunda , that the bulk
a02-098-07 of moderates and Africans will reject the
a02-098-08 Constitution unless it is modified .
a02-046-00 At 9.40 Mr. Edusei , Minister of Transport and pro-
a02-046-01 bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team ,
a02-046-02 drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
a02-046-03 demonstrators , most of them shopgirls in overalls .
a02-046-04 " If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock , " he
a02-046-05 told them , ' the police will act . ' At five to ten
a02-046-06 a posse of police arrived and in less than
a02-046-07 two minutes the crowd had gone .
a02-050-00 If the threatened " counter-revolution " was not * to bring
a02-050-01 the President back from his travels it might have been
a02-050-02 thought that the muster from the 13 States of the
a02-050-03 Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence .
a02-050-04 After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this
a02-050-05 year the Economic Consultative Council should meet
a02-053-00 It has been left , however , to Mr. Goka , Ghana's Finance
a02-053-01 Minister , to do the honours as host , in which capacity
a02-053-02 he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
a02-053-03 Hotel . POLICE , on direct orders from the Cabinet , are
a02-053-04 openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
a02-053-05 disarming Committee of 100 , the Committee claimed
a02-053-06 yesterday . It said pressure was being put on
a02-053-07 members and associates all over the country .
a02-057-00 It alleged : Phones were being tapped and
a02-057-01 going out of action ; Police were visiting
a02-057-02 people " on no pretext whatsoever , except
a02-057-03 to pass the time of day " ; Supporters had
a02-057-04 been warned - one that his connection
a02-057-05 with the committee was going too far ; another
a02-057-06 that anti-apartheid agitation was
a02-057-07 all right , but support for the committee
a02-062-00 A third man's house was watched for four days
a02-062-01 by plain-clothes men . Committee-member Mr. George
a02-062-02 Clark commented at a Press conference : " The
a02-062-03 most extraordinary things are happening . " Fifty
a02-062-04 committee members will appear at Bow-street
a02-062-05 today , including Lord Russell , Lady Russell ,
a02-062-06 Lord Boyd-Orr , the Rev. Michael Scott , and
a02-067-00 They are required to show why they
a02-067-01 should not be bound over for disturbing
a02-067-02 the peace and for inciting a breach
a02-067-03 of the peace . The summonses say they
a02-067-04 are " likely to persevere in such unlawful
a02-067-05 conduct . " Lord Russell , 89 , was
a02-067-06 putting his affairs in order , and
a02-067-07 packing a case , at his Chelsea home
a02-067-08 yesterday . His secretary , American-born
a02-067-09 Mr. Ralph Schoenman , said :
a02-072-00 " He is not going to agree to be bound over . That will
a02-072-01 probably mean jail and , though frail , he is very fit and
a02-072-02 will take the rigours of prison in his stride . He
a02-072-03 hopes to be allowed to do some writing . " Back at
a02-072-04 the Press conference , Mr. Clark said two committee
a02-072-05 members tried a " plant " call on suspect phone . They
a02-072-06 discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none
a02-072-07 was planned but police turned up .
a02-078-00 Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no
a02-078-01 longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth
a02-078-02 Kaunda . Sir Roy , Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister ,
a02-078-03 said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence
a02-078-04 Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
a02-078-05 National Congress , which was led by Mr. Kaunda
a02-078-06 until he was outlawed in 1959 . The record
a02-078-07 of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
a02-078-08 back a long way , Sir Roy told the
a02-078-09 Federal Parliament in Salisbury .
a02-082-00 He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
a02-082-01 had been arrested or convicted since last year on
a02-082-02 charges of creating disturbances . During the first
a02-082-03 three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
a02-082-04 had been reported in Northern Rhodesia . More
a02-082-05 than 500 people - 167 of them members of
a02-082-06 the UNIP - were convicted last month in the
a02-086-00 " Against this background must be taken Mr.
a02-086-01 Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is
a02-086-02 doing is in the name of non-violence , " said
a02-086-03 Sir Roy . " I am now compelled to say that
a02-086-04 I don't accept his good faith . " He said
a02-086-05 Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements
a02-086-06 had stimulated violence , but he had done
a02-102-00 A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of
a02-102-01 Buganda ( King Freddie ) from Princess
a02-102-02 Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro , kneeling at the
a02-102-03 foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport
a02-102-04 yesterday . Forty other Africans greeted him ,
a02-102-05 kneeling with heads bowed . The princess ,
a02-102-06 aged 24 , is now studying history at Cambri-
a02-102-07 dge , where she is a friend of Prince William
a02-106-00 King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of
a02-106-01 native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with
a02-106-02 Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod , before the
a02-106-03 Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday .
a02-106-04 The question : Their status in an independent Uganda .
a02-106-05 The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
a02-106-06 to settle the relationships between them and the
a02-106-07 rest of the country . A Government report has
a02-106-08 recognised their rights and recommended a form of
a02-106-09 federal association , but the four kings are not
a02-111-00 Instead , the kings will remain in London
a02-111-01 and wait to hear the conference's proposals .
a02-111-02 Then their views will be transmitted back .
a02-111-03 MR. BUTLER , the Home Secretary , has decided
a02-111-04 to meet head-on the biggest challenge to
a02-111-05 Government authority yet presented by the
a02-111-06 " Ban-the-Bomb " demonstrators . Police leave
a02-111-07 has been cancelled and secret plans prepared
a02-111-08 to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned
a02-111-09 for Sunday in Parliament-square by the
a02-111-10 Committee of 100 , the anti-nuclear arms
a02-124-00 Measures agreed so far include : 1 . A mass
a02-124-01 call-out of police , special constables
a02-124-02 and reserves , with 750 policemen posted
a02-124-03 from outlying districts to stations in
a02-124-04 the area - West End Central , Bow-street ,
a03-047-00 It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
a03-047-01 in the role of a popular orator at the
a03-047-02 hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
a03-047-03 baker was in the last two campaigns . The
a03-047-04 impression remains that the Liberal leader
a03-047-05 is still the diplomatist , more at home
a03-047-06 in the chancery , or the corridors of the United
a03-047-07 Nations , not the father figure , so necessary
a03-047-08 in Canadian leadership , or the practical
a03-047-09 politician , able to talk about sewage problems
a02-116-00 It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
a02-116-01 ended yesterday in 32 members of the
a02-116-02 Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
a02-116-03 a breach of the peace . The committee's
a02-116-04 president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
a02-116-05 his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
a02-116-06 a week . Playwrights Arnold Wesker ( The Kitchen )
a02-116-07 and Robert Bolt ( The Flowering Cherry ) were
a02-120-00 The possibility that the Government might
a02-120-01 invoke the Public Order Act , 1936 , and
a02-120-02 declare the whole rally illegal - whether
a02-120-03 the demonstrators sit down or not - was
a02-120-04 being discussed in Whitehall last night .
a02-120-05 It was last used a year ago , to deal
a02-120-06 with the St. Pancras rent riots . Today
a02-120-07 Mr. Butler will have talks with Police
a02-120-08 Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to
a02-120-09 draw up final plans for the " Battle
a02-120-10 of Parliament Square . "
a03-006-00 Today , for example , the Foreign Minister of Indo-
a03-006-01 nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
a03-006-02 Foreign Minister . In fact such Yugoslav activity has
a03-006-03 been # particularly intensified in the past year
a03-006-04 or so and though so far , apart from joint action
a03-006-05 in the United Nations , these exchanges have not
a03-006-06 been seen on any wider basis , President Tito
a03-006-07 is known for some time to have favoured a
a03-006-08 conference of neutralist leaders .
a03-009-00 The wish was particularly apparent in comments
a03-009-01 on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and ,
a03-009-02 in particular , in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an
a03-009-03 inter-African consultative assembly which would
a03-009-04 coordinate activity on the political and economic
a03-009-05 sphere ; and it is not difficult to see that President
a03-009-06 Tito would like some such idea extended also
a03-009-07 to the whole uncommitted world
a03-011-00 But he now feels , in view of a changed international
a03-011-01 situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing
a03-011-02 the new and independent countries of Africa , that the
a03-011-03 time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
a03-011-04 the uncommitted countries and even to work out common
a03-011-05 stands on various problems facing those nations . Two
a03-011-06 subjects , the Congo and Algeria , are the main topics
a03-011-07 of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two
a03-011-08 leaders have identical ideas .
a03-014-00 Two emissaries from the Laotian Government
a03-014-01 of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in
a03-014-02 Phnom Penh , Cambodia , to invite Prince
a03-014-03 Souvanna Phouma , the former Prime Min-
a03-014-04 ister , to return to Laos . No details of
a03-014-05 their mission have been disclosed , but it
a03-014-06 was reported earlier in Laos that Prince
a03-014-07 Boun Oum was considering asking
a03-014-08 Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his
a03-017-00 Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
a03-017-01 the mission , but recent statements made by him
a03-017-02 in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
a03-017-03 himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
a03-017-04 Laos . His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
a03-017-05 to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though
a03-017-06 at the cost of virtual partition of the country
a03-017-07 into the pro-communist north and the
a03-017-08 pro-western centre and south .
a03-020-00 Prince Souvanna's former Minister of
a03-020-01 Information , Mr. Quinim Pholsena , who
a03-020-02 claims to be his representative in
a03-020-03 Laos , yesterday addressed all officers
a03-020-04 of the pro-communist forces
a03-020-05 occupying the province of Xieng
a03-020-06 Khouang and emphasized that
a03-020-07 Prince Souphannouvong , leader
a03-020-08 of the pro-communist Neo Lao
a03-020-09 Haksat Party , also to the officers
a03-020-10 in the same terms .
a03-023-00 This emphasis on the legality of the former
a03-023-01 Government suggests that all is not well
a03-023-02 with the political and military leadership
a03-023-03 of the pro-communists . Most of the
a03-023-04 province of Xieng Khouang and the
a03-023-05 tactically useful Plain of Jars , however ,
a03-023-06 appear still to be firmly in their hands .
a03-023-07 The Government has claimed the
a03-023-08 recapture of Vang Vieng , the pro-
a03-023-09 communists' former base 60 miles
a03-023-10 north of Vientiane , but this claim
a03-027-00 A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within
a03-027-01 a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that
a03-027-02 this village was still held by the pro-communists .
a03-027-03 With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica
a03-027-04 and # his Cabinet out in the grass roots making
a03-027-05 160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days , the Liberal
a03-027-06 Party are holding a national conference here with
a03-027-07 some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958
a03-027-08 when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
a03-030-00 In some ways it will be a testing occasion
a03-030-01 for him , although some think his position
a03-030-02 unassailable simply because there is no one
a03-030-03 else in sight to supplant him . So the con-
a03-030-04 ference will concentrate on laying the
a03-030-05 foundations on which to win the next
a03-030-06 election . The rally comes at a time
a03-030-07 when in spite of carefully worded state-
a03-030-08 ments by the Prime Minister there is an
a03-030-09 air of electoral expectancy .
a03-034-00 Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
a03-034-01 a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
a03-034-02 which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
a03-034-03 of the party since it came to office three and
a03-034-04 a half years ago . Nevertheless there is little
a03-034-05 illusion in the Conservative Party that their
a03-034-06 stock at home has fallen in the face of
a03-034-07 heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy .
a03-037-00 Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
a03-037-01 provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and
a03-037-02 in the four federal by-elections last October the party
a03-037-03 fared badly . They are now faced with four other by-
a03-037-04 elections , one at Esquimalt Saanich , British Columbia ,
a03-037-05 one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the
a03-037-06 Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska , New Brunswick ,
a03-037-07 and Kings , Prince Edward Island .
a03-040-00 All four were Conservative strongholds . Last September
a03-040-01 a public poll showed that for the first time since
a03-040-02 the Administration came to power in 1957 the
a03-040-03 Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour
a03-040-04 of " The Grits " if a federal election had been
a03-040-05 held last autumn , 38 per cent for the
a03-040-06 Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F. ) .
a03-043-00 However , a separate poll revealed that Mr.
a03-043-01 Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
a03-043-02 popularity as an individual leader ( for
a03-043-03 Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent , for Mr.
a03-043-04 Pearson 34 per cent ) . How far is Mr.
a03-043-05 Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
a03-043-06 of Canada as a Prime Minister ? Many
a03-043-07 observers at the national rally will be
a03-054-00 Everything is being done to promote
a03-054-01 a new image . Certainly , he is now a
a03-054-02 much lessly trounced by Mr. Diefen-
a03-054-03 baker in the House in those early
a03-054-04 days . It has been a hard road back
a03-054-05 but now , with plenty of political
a03-054-06 ammunition given him by the Gov-
a03-054-07 ernment in recent sessions , he is
a03-054-08 leading the Opposition with skill and
a03-054-09 assurance and is a match for the
a03-054-10 Prime Minister across the floor .
a03-059-01 Mr. Pearson is now talking about " his
a03-059-02 new and dynamic liberalism " and this
a03-059-03 week will # show perhaps how far " Mike
a03-059-04 will go . The main topic under review is
a03-059-05 unemployment , but there will be 21
a03-059-06 committees examining subjects
a03-059-07 ranging from foreign investment in
a03-059-08 Canada to the problems of the Atlantic
a03-059-09 provinces . However , be this election
a03-059-10 year or not , Mr. Pearson , with his party
a03-059-11 increasingly confident of return to power ,
a03-063-01 Mr. Thorneycroft , the Minister of Aviation , who arrives in
a03-063-02 Bonn tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a
a03-063-03 European space satellite project , will find the Germans
a03-063-04 interested in the principle of space research , but rather
a03-063-05 sceptical about British plans for organizing it .
a03-063-06 Stated more bluntly , they are still unconvinced that
a03-063-07 this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to
a03-063-08 salve Blue Streak , which was abandoned last summer
a03-063-09 as a military project ; or that the European space satellite
a03-063-10 is indeed to be purely scientific in character .
a03-066-00 Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
a03-066-01 remove these doubts , and to persuade the
a03-066-02 Federal Government that the financial burden
a03-066-03 involved is really worth while , at a time when
a03-066-04 any increase in budgetary commitments
a03-066-05 would almost certainly involve a corresponding
a03-066-06 rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
a03-066-07 to contemplate in an election year .
a04-000-00 PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure
a04-000-01 on Mr. Harold Macmillan to join the
a04-000-02 Common Market during their talks at Admiralty
a04-000-03 House , Whitehall , yesterday . Much of their
a04-000-04 three hours , 20 minutes of discussion is believed
a04-000-05 to have been devoted to this main point
a04-003-00 It arose during talks following
a04-003-01 President Kennedy's report to the British
a04-003-02 Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent
a04-003-03 visit to Paris . There General de Gaulle had made
a04-003-04 clear that he would accept Britain into the
a04-003-05 Common Market only if there were no conditions
a04-003-06 laid down to meet the Commonwealth
a04-003-07 and other reservations .
a04-006-00 Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still
a04-006-01 wanted him to apply for membership of the Common
a04-006-02 Market , even if it meant an unconditional surrender .
a04-006-03 There were also brief discussions on Laos , Berlin
a04-006-04 and other foreign questions , after Mr. Kennedy had
a04-006-05 informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr.
a04-006-06 Krushchov . With the exception of 40 minutes when
a04-006-07 Lord Home , Foreign Secretary , and Mr. McGeorge
a04-006-08 Bundy , the President's special assistant for
a04-006-09 security affairs , were brought in , the two
a04-010-00 An attempt to get more information about the
a04-010-01 Admiralty House meeting will be made in the
a04-010-02 House of Commons this afternoon . Labour M.P.s already
a04-010-03 have many questions to the Prime Minister asking
a04-010-04 for a statement . President Kennedy flew from London
a04-010-05 Airport last night to arrive in Washington this
a04-010-06 morning . He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide
a04-010-07 broadcast and television report on his
a04-010-08 talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening .
a04-015-00 The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's
a04-015-01 third talks - the first were at Key West , Florida , the second in
a04-015-02 Washington - said : " Their discussions covered the major problems ,
a04-015-03 both economic and political , and revealed once again the
a04-015-04 close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their
a04-015-05 common purposes . " Occasion was given to review the need for
a04-015-06 economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests
a04-015-07 of developed and underdeveloped countries alike . "
a04-019-00 It said that the President and Premier noted " with satisfaction " the
a04-019-01 agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire ,
a04-019-02 which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the
a04-019-03 Geneva conference . " Particular attention was also given to the
a04-019-04 nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament . " The
a04-019-05 situation in regard to Germany was reviewed , and there was full
a04-019-06 agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
a04-019-07 obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin . "
a04-023-00 Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks , followed by lunch
a04-023-01 given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other
a04-023-02 guests present , Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more
a04-023-03 times yesterday . In PARIS , Mr. Dean Rusk , U.S. Secretary of
a04-023-04 State , gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the
a04-023-05 15-nation Nato council . Some of his listeners said he was
a04-023-06 " rather pessimistic " and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year .
a04-027-00 From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle
a04-027-01 and informed him of the Vienna outcome . Last night Mr. Rusk arrived
a04-027-02 in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
a04-027-03 fly home with the President . In DUESSELDORF , Chancellor Adenauer
a04-027-04 said the Vienna talks " might be the beginning of a slight improvement , "
a04-027-05 but no big changes should be expected in the political situation .
a04-031-00 RELAXED , smiling and clearly in the best of
a04-031-01 spirits , Mr. Krushchov yesterday returned to
a04-031-02 Moscow after his two days of talks with President
a04-031-03 Kennedy , writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow . The
a04-031-04 good beginning made at Vienna must be
a04-031-05 followed up by new efforts for peace , the
a04-031-06 Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
a04-031-07 declared yesterday . Events in Vienna " gave hope
a04-031-08 to people of goodwill who hate the cold war ,
a04-031-09 and to all who are striving for a stable peace , "
a04-035-00 " Thinking over the results of the Vienna
a04-035-01 meeting , peace-loving people will say ' a
a04-035-02 good beginning . ' " Mr. Krushchov remained at the
a04-035-03 airport to join President Brezhnev in welcoming
a04-035-04 Dr. Sukarno , President and Prime Minister of
a04-035-05 Indonesia , who arrived by Boeing 707 jet on a
a04-035-06 state visit 40 minutes after Mr. Khrushchov had
a04-035-07 arrived from Vienna . A cheering , delighted crowd
a04-035-08 of Indonesian students broke through crash barriers
a04-035-09 to surround their President on the tarmac for
a04-039-00 In VIENNA , before flying off to Moscow ,
a04-039-01 Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend
a04-039-02 talks with President Kennedy would # help " to
a04-039-03 establish an enduring peace between nations . "
a04-039-04 Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President
a04-039-05 Schaerf , the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for
a04-039-06 the hospitality and welcome he had received .
a04-039-07 " The Soviet Union has always striven and is
a04-039-08 striving to safeguard an enduring peace for
a04-039-09 the peoples , to secure an early solution of the
a04-043-00 MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded
a04-043-01 defence of the Polaris missile base . And by
a04-043-02 implication he supported the establishment of
a04-043-03 sites in Britain for the training of German
a04-043-04 troops . His main theme was that nuclear
a04-043-05 weapons were necessary to defend Britain , that
a04-043-06 Britain must depend on Nato and " the West "
a04-043-07 must have nuclear weapons so long as the
a04-047-00 Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
a04-047-01 of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt
a04-047-02 sure the Labour movement was coming round in
a04-047-03 support of his views . Obviously conscious of the fierce and
a04-047-04 widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
a04-047-05 Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
a04-047-06 supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
a04-047-07 their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
a04-050-00 Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
a04-050-01 not deny facilities to nations to which it was
a04-050-02 allied . But governments should be free to negotiate
a04-050-03 and refuse proposals with which they did not
a04-050-04 agree . The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because ,
a04-050-05 he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and
a04-054-00 That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine .
a04-054-01 So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons ,
a04-054-02 the West , somewhere , must have them too . It
a04-054-03 was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
a04-054-04 purposes to be under the sea rather than on land .
a04-054-05 This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
a04-054-06 to oppose the Polaris depot ship .
a04-059-00 The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
a04-059-01 in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a
a04-059-02 city with two million people . It should be sited
a04-059-03 in a more remote area . Mr. Gaitskell added that
a04-059-04 the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his
a04-059-05 view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority
a04-059-06 of party members and still less the party's
a04-066-00 Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
a04-066-01 unilateralists was not possible , though
a04-066-02 he respected their views . He saw by reports
a04-066-03 that " those who organise these things " were
a04-066-04 recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
a04-066-05 disarmament to shift the emphasis of
a04-066-06 their intervention away from straight opposition
a04-066-07 to the official document on to opposition
a04-069-00 To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the
a04-069-01 Prime Minister should begin to take
a04-069-02 seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
a04-069-03 weapons within the Nato alliance . " Let us say
a04-069-04 to Macmillan that he should press , I hope
a04-069-05 with the agreement of Kennedy , in
a04-069-06 talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment
a04-069-07 in central Europe of a zone of controlled
a04-072-00 He thought , he said , that the Soviet
a04-072-01 Union would be prepared to reach
a04-072-02 an agreement on a zone of controlled
a04-072-03 disarmament in Europe . Mr Gaitskell
a04-072-04 concluded , declaring that the present
a04-072-05 was the beginning of a great period of
a04-072-06 opportunity for the party . It was a
a04-072-07 great chance that should be grasped .
a04-072-08 Inter-union jealousies prevent the
a04-072-09 fulfilment of a common policy for wages
a04-072-10 and other major questions , Mr. Jack Cooper
a04-081-00 The General Council of the Trades Union
a04-081-01 Congress should therefore consider the
a04-081-02 matter . Consideration should also be given
a04-081-03 to the regrouping of unions and the
a04-081-04 modification of their structures to
a04-081-05 meet the growing concentration of
a04-081-06 capital . Mr. Cooper argued that a
a04-081-07 common industrial contribution was
a04-081-08 urgent - particularly in unions serving
a04-081-09 workers in the same industry - along
a04-085-00 Suggesting that a total T.U.C.
a04-085-01 membership of eight million was a " poor
a04-085-02 show " compared with some countries , he
a04-085-03 argued that the position needed examination .
a04-085-04 BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
a04-085-05 Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
a04-085-06 the views of a wide section of the
a04-085-07 British people about Polaris submarine
a04-085-08 bases in this country . An open letter
a04-085-09 written by Earl Russell hoping that the
a04-089-00 Earl Russell , President of the Committee
a04-089-01 of 100 , told Kennedy that he should
a04-089-02 take notice of " that very large and
a04-089-03 growing section which is opposed to
a04-089-04 the establishment of a Polaris base ,
a04-089-05 whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
a04-089-06 British territory . " He pointed out that
a04-089-07 already there have been protests but
a04-089-08 that " very much larger protests are to
a04-089-09 be expected and are being planned . "
a04-092-00 There are three kinds of reasons that justify
a04-092-01 the protests and these should carry weight with
a04-092-02 the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested . " The
a04-092-03 first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
a04-092-04 serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
a04-092-05 U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government
a04-092-06 circles , but in public opinion . " Earl Russell
a04-092-07 says it is inevitable , though profoundly
a04-092-08 regrettable , that the agitation against
a04-092-09 the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
a04-092-10 to the policy of the United States .
a04-096-00 The second reason is concerned with doubts
a04-096-01 as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ;
a04-096-02 " in the time of crisis it would probably be
a04-096-03 impossible for the British authorities to
a04-096-04 exercise any degree of control over the action
a04-096-05 of Polaris submarines . " He argues that
a04-096-06 there is a distinct possibility that so long
a04-096-07 as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
a04-096-08 Soviet Union might retaliate against
a04-099-00 " Such retaliation might , and probably would ,
a04-099-01 destroy the whole population of Britain in
a04-099-02 the course of , at the most , an hour " without
a04-099-03 provoking American retaliation . Earl Russell
a04-099-04 believes : " It is very questionable whether
a04-099-05 British membership of Nato and British
a04-099-06 permission of American bases on our territory
a04-099-07 add anything to the strength of America ,
a04-099-08 while , on the contrary , they impose upon
a04-099-09 America an onerous obligation which it
a04-099-10 may prove impossible to fulfil . "
a04-103-00 The third reason is that the supreme
a04-103-01 interest for the whole world - East and
a04-103-02 West and uncommitted nations - is the
a04-103-03 prevention of nuclear war . " A rapidly
a04-103-04 growing body of opinion in this country
a04-103-05 believes that Britain could be more effective
a04-103-06 in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
a04-103-07 by helping to suggest agreements which could
a04-103-08 be accepted by both East and West . "
a05-004-00 Short of wearing the same uniform , which is
a05-004-01 not contemplated , the Navy , Army and Royal
a05-004-02 Air Force would become , for practical purposes ,
a05-004-03 a single defence force . There would be
a05-004-04 complete co-operation at all levels in training
a05-004-05 and operations . This would apply also in the
a05-004-06 command structure and central administrative
a05-004-07 organisation . Mr. Watkinson , Minister of Defence ,
a05-004-08 has been working on the plan for some months ,
a05-004-09 with the Prime Minister's approval .
a05-009-00 He has had numerous meetings with the Service
a05-009-01 Ministers . He has also had talks with the Earl
a05-009-02 of Home , Foreign Secretary , and with other
a05-009-03 Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
a05-009-04 of defence policy . Details of the scheme
a05-009-05 are now being worked out by the Chiefs
a05-009-06 of Staff , a process that may take four
a06-000-00 MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans
a06-000-01 to catch speculators in shares and property .
a06-000-02 The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to
a06-000-03 public opinion over his " July Budget " came
a06-000-04 dramatically in the Commons yesterday . Mr
a06-000-05 Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed
a06-000-06 to deal in his next regular Budget with
a06-000-07 some profits which now escape tax .
a06-004-00 Sir Edward Boyle , Financial Secretary
a06-004-01 to the Treasury , said yesterday that the
a06-004-02 Government does not like retrospective legislation .
a06-004-03 He went on to describe the kind of
a06-004-04 people the Chancellor hopes to tax . These
a06-004-05 are people buying and selling shares within
a06-004-06 a short period , those " stagging " on a new issue
a06-004-07 and property dealers who form a chain of
a06-004-08 companies and put one property deal through
a06-008-00 Mr. Harold Wilson , Shadow Chancellor , jumped up to
a06-008-01 offer the Government an easy passage for such
a06-008-02 legislation . " Why don't you make proposals to legislate
a06-008-03 in the autumn ? " Mr. Wilson asked . " We wouldn't call
a06-008-04 it an Autumn Budget . You can call it a Taxation
a06-008-05 Management Bill , if you like . " While Mr. Wilson
a06-008-06 was speaking , the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd
a06-008-07 had a whispered conversation .
a06-014-00 They nodded at each other and Sir Edward
a06-014-01 rose to say that the Chancellor would bear
a06-014-02 Mr. Wilson's offer in mind . Guy Eden writes :
a06-014-03 Treasury experts are already working on
a06-014-04 the scheme . Profits of genuine investors
a06-014-05 in industry will not be affected , but only
a06-014-06 quick in-and-out speculator deals .
a06-014-07 FRANK FOULKES , Communist president
a06-014-08 of the ETU , refused yesterday to
a06-014-09 " commit suicide " at the TUC's
a06-020-00 He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the
a06-020-01 ETU. In reply to the call for his resignation he said : " Our rules
a06-020-02 say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again
a06-020-03 for three years . " I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire ,
a06-020-04 so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that
a06-025-00 The other TUC demands : Five leading
a06-025-01 Communists must not hold office for five
a06-025-02 years ; Sub-committees set up to strip
a06-025-03 secretary John Byrne of his powers must
a06-025-04 disband in ten days . These the ETU
a06-025-05 executive rejected as " wholly unacceptable "
a06-025-06 and " unwarranted " interference . " But it
a06-025-07 agreed to postpone operation of the sub-
a06-036-00 The small rocket craft , for destroying big
a06-036-01 ships , are controlled automatically , even
a06-036-02 to the preparations for launching their
a06-036-03 rockets . Applauding on the river banks at
a06-036-04 Leningrad were thousands now told that in
a06-036-05 20 years they will have free food , housing , light ,
a06-036-06 heat , transport and medical treatment - all
a06-036-07 for a working week of 34 to 36 hours .
a06-039-00 " The whole naval might of the Soviet
a06-039-01 Union can be seen here - a truly inspiring
a06-039-02 and proud sight , " said Moscow radio's
a06-039-03 commentator . The parade was reviewed by
a06-039-04 Marshal Andrei Grechko , commanding the
a06-039-05 forces of the Warsaw Pact countries -
a06-039-06 the Communist " Nato . " He said rocket-
a06-039-07 carrying atomic submarines now formed
a06-039-08 the basis of the Soviet Navy . MR.
a06-039-09 MACMILLAN'S announcement in the
a06-039-10 Commons of his momentous
a06-044-00 Mr. Anthony Fell ( Yarmouth ) called the decision " shocking "
a06-044-01 and added : " It is the most disastrous thing any Prime
a06-044-02 Minister has done for many , many generations . " He
a06-044-03 concluded : " The best service the Prime Minister can do
a06-044-04 would be to resign . " The outburst shocked MPs of
a06-044-05 all parties . Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
a06-051-00 There were loud cries of " shame " from
a06-051-01 all parts of the Conservative side . Mr.
a06-051-02 Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
a06-051-03 down . A few minutes later , Mr. Fell got up
a06-051-04 and left the chamber . He returned five
a06-051-05 minutes later to stand just inside the
a06-051-06 doorway looking more composed . In the
a06-051-07 middle of the amazing scene , Mr. Macmillan
a06-051-08 waved his hand at Mr. Fell .
a06-057-00 This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more . " I cannot be told
a06-057-01 to sit down by the Prime Minister . " Protests had been expected
a06-057-02 from Tory rebels . But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented . He
a06-057-03 accused the Prime Minister of " political double talk . " " It had
a06-057-04 the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
a06-057-05 Minister is a national disaster , " he said .
a06-064-00 Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had , if
a06-064-01 anything , rallied support to the Prime Minister .
a06-064-02 This apparently , was Mr. Macmillan's assessment .
a06-064-03 He confined his reply to the observation
a06-064-04 that Mr. Fell had probably " maximised his
a06-064-05 support . " There were no other attacks
a06-064-06 of such ferocity . But there was ample
a06-064-07 evidence of Conservative and Labour
a06-064-08 opposition , which will be aired in the
a06-064-09 debate tomorrow and on Thursday .
a06-070-00 As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement , the
a06-070-01 House was crowded . He said : " No # British
a06-070-02 Government could join the European Economic
a06-070-03 Community without prior negotiation with a view
a06-070-04 to meeting the needs of the Commonwealth countries ,
a06-070-05 of our European Free Trade Association partners
a06-070-06 and of British agriculture . " Near the end of a
a06-070-07 long statement , Mr. Macmillan stated the
a06-075-00 " After long and earnest consideration , Her
a06-075-01 Majesty's Government have come to the
a06-075-02 conclusion that it would be right for
a06-075-03 Britain to make a formal application . .
a06-075-04 for negotiations with a view to joining
a06-075-05 the Community . " At this point , Mr. Paul
a06-075-06 Williams ( Cons. , Sunderland ) called out
a06-075-07 " Shame . " Mr. Williams is a close
a06-075-08 associate of Mr. Fell .
a06-090-00 He claimed that , unless we were in the
a06-090-01 Common Market , we should not be able to
a06-090-02 play any part in # determining its future .
a06-090-03 " We can lead better from within , " he said .
a06-090-04 Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection
a06-090-05 raised by Tory critics . Mr. Anthony Fell ,
a06-090-06 who created a scene on this point on
a06-090-07 Monday , took up a position almost hidden
a06-090-08 behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair .
a06-095-00 Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
a06-095-01 to the Commonwealth through the
a06-095-02 strength we would gain in the Common
a06-095-03 Market than by isolation . He paid
a06-095-04 tribute to the development of the
a06-095-05 Common Market . " The Community
a06-095-06 ( Common Market ) has imparted an
a06-095-07 impetus and an economic growth
a06-095-08 to The Six . Above all , it is an idea
a06-095-09 which has gripped men's minds , "
a06-100-00 Referring to previous negotiations , Mr. Macmillan looked towards
a06-100-01 Mr. Reginald Maudling . " These were negotiations in which the
a06-100-02 President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part , " the
a06-100-03 Premier said . He dismissed the idea that Britain would be
a06-100-04 swamped by cheap labour . Our industry , he said , would
a06-100-05 probably gain . " Many people feel we have had , perhaps , too
n02-146-00 She was tempted to laugh , but it was as though that barb still stuck
n02-146-01 in her quivering flesh . " You 've an answer - of sorts - for everything , " she
n02-146-02 said shortly . " Personally I 've no more to say , so I suggest we get
n02-146-03 along . " To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
n02-146-04 where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in
n02-146-05 leisurely fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and
n02-146-06 incredibly ancient car , surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives .
a06-110-00 Conservatives protested when
a06-110-01 Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
a06-110-02 told this " by some # people
a06-110-03 of considerable authority , " he
a06-110-04 retorted . " I agree with the Prime
a06-110-05 Minister that I do not think
a06-110-06 we are necessarily bound for
a06-110-07 federalism in Europe , " he went
a06-114-00 If we joined the Common Market , our
a06-114-01 food subsidies would probably be
a06-114-02 replaced by a system of tariffs " That
a06-114-03 will mean a rise in the cost of living . "
a06-114-04 BUDGETTE or no Budgette YOU are
a06-114-05 spending more as the summer holiday
a06-114-06 season moves into top gear .
a06-114-07 On the eve of August Bank Holiday
a06-114-08 the spending spree is at a new
a06-119-00 Note circulation soared for the
a06-119-01 sixth successive week - this
a06-119-02 time by more than 15,000,000 # last
a06-119-03 week . And that brought the figure
a06-119-04 to a record 2,415,000,000 . This was
a06-119-05 100,000,000 more than the corresponding
a06-119-06 week last year and 37,000,000 up on
a06-119-07 the 1960 record set last Christmas .
a06-119-08 Now look at the other side of all
a06-128-00 Banks have paid in a first
a06-128-01 instalment of almost 8,000,000
a06-128-02 in response to the Budgette appeal .
a06-128-03 About another 70,000,000 is due
a06-128-04 by September 20 . For nearly a year
a06-128-05 about 150,000,000 has been frozen .
a06-128-06 MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
a06-128-07 German militarism in his replies to
a06-128-08 the West on Berlin . And he repeats
a06-128-09 that the problem " must be solved
a06-124-00 The big " squeeze " means that it is going to be more
a06-124-01 difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft . And banks will be
a06-124-02 stricter in recalling existing overdrafts . This is underlined in
a06-124-03 the Central Bank's weekly return ... ... which shows that more
a06-124-04 than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the
a06-124-05 form of special deposits with the Bank of England .
a06-134-00 The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
a06-134-01 West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday . They
a06-134-02 tell : The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
a06-134-03 treaty with Germany causes no real danger . West Germany ,
a06-134-04 with its militarists and revenge-seekers , is becoming a
a06-134-05 hotbed of war danger in Europe . Even now , aided by
a06-134-06 the U.S. , Britain and France , it has more than enough
a06-134-07 forces and arms to touch off a world war .
a06-141-00 BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being
a06-141-01 put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed
a06-141-02 Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British
a06-141-03 cities . FRANCE - One can hardly conceive the French are
a06-141-04 not alarmed ... . Next door , in West Germany , before everyone's
a06-141-05 eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi
a06-147-00 With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to self-
a06-147-01 determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence .
a06-147-02 WEST GERMANY - Russia would like to see a clear #
a06-147-03 realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours
a06-147-04 of a third world war . The best way to rule out such a tragic
a06-147-05 contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous
a06-147-06 growth of West Berlin's occupation status .
a06-157-00 This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the
a06-157-01 East German disturbances on July 17 , 1953 . And officials
a06-157-02 fear it may be too much for the city's refugee camps .
a06-157-03 They will overflow and private houses will have to be used .
e07-000-00 WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain
e07-000-01 when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons
e07-000-02 of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when
e07-000-03 20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin . An eye-
e07-000-04 witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with
e07-000-05 the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti-
a06-152-00 Behind Bonn's slogan of German self-
a06-152-01 determination is the intention to impose
a06-152-02 on East Germany the regime existing in
a06-152-03 West Germany . REFUGEES are pouring out
a06-152-04 # of East Germany into West
a06-152-05 Berlin faster than ever . Mr. K's latest
a06-152-06 speech scared 1,157 East Germans to
a06-152-07 cross into West Berlin's reception centre
a06-152-08 DURING MONDAY NIGHT . And officials
a06-152-09 expect the total to leap to
b01-000-00 Prime Minister after Prime Minister speaks out
b01-000-01 in revulsion against the South African
b01-000-02 Government's policy of apartheid as we wait
b01-000-03 for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth
b01-000-04 Conference in London . Will it end with
b01-000-05 South Africa's exclusion from the
b01-000-06 Commonwealth ? The issue is touch and go .
b01-004-00 There is a possibility that it will not be
b01-004-01 settled at this conference . It may be agreed to
b01-004-02 wait until South Africa actually becomes a
b01-004-03 Republic later in the year . But if a final
b01-004-04 decision is to be faced now , on which side
b01-004-05 do the strongest arguments lie ? THE Archbishop
b01-004-06 of Capetown has shown that the matter is
b01-009-00 The Archbishop has long been a courageous
b01-009-01 fighter against apartheid . He must be heard
b01-009-02 with attention . On purely practical grounds he
b01-009-03 holds that it would be a mistake to expel
b01-009-04 South Africa , weakening the whites who are
b01-009-05 working for a change of policy . In his view
b01-009-06 it would also be against the interests of the
b01-014-00 He holds that more pressure can be put on South
b01-014-01 Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth
b01-014-02 than could be exercised were she cut off from it .
b01-014-03 On the other hand , those who favour expulsion , inclu-
b01-014-04 ding African leaders , feel that nothing less than the
b01-014-05 shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
b01-014-06 Verwoerd and the Nationalists . They point out
b01-014-07 that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning
b01-018-00 THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society . A
b01-018-01 policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
b01-018-02 is surely the one thing that it could not survive .
b01-018-03 Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
b01-018-04 London , millions at home would regard as fraudulent
b01-018-05 a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
b01-018-06 South Africa . And this is a Commonwealth in
b01-018-07 which five citizens are coloured for every one
b01-023-00 Seen in this wider picture , a South Africa that clings to
b01-023-01 apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
b01-023-02 liability to the whole Western world . A practical
b01-023-03 solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
b01-023-04 a set of principles excluding race discrimination .
b01-023-05 And so leave South Africa to make the grade ,
b01-027-00 THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
b01-027-01 tonight from their tour in the East . The duke's
b01-027-02 trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
b01-027-03 have taken the headlines in this country .
b01-027-04 Nevertheless , the tour has been an immense
b01-027-05 success . The Queen has won a triumph . It
b01-027-06 would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
b01-027-07 performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
b01-027-08 dropped from future Royal programmes .
b01-033-00 But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
b01-033-01 their visit . The warmth of their welcome in India and
b01-033-02 Pakistan are happy memories . WEST GERMANY - followed
b01-033-03 yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
b01-033-04 of a good neighbour . She has put up the value
b01-038-00 Certainly , the rise is very small . But it is a step
b01-038-01 in the direction of live-and-let-live . Hopes
b01-038-02 will now grow brighter of further international
b01-038-03 co-operation , which is the only way to solve the
b01-038-04 payments difficulties that upset the Western world .
b01-038-05 Britain and the U.S. , which have problems with
b01-038-06 their balances , will gain some immediate help .
b01-038-07 What it means in practical terms is that our
b01-038-08 exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
b01-038-09 for Germans to buy , while the goods which
b01-038-10 Germany exports will be made a little dearer .
b01-044-00 Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
b01-044-01 as a means to curb rising prices at home . She is
b01-044-02 also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
b01-044-03 by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
b01-044-04 should . Germany exports much more than she imports .
b01-044-05 For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
b01-044-06 dollars have been drained into Germany .
b01-049-00 There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
b01-049-01 Germany has no tradition of trading abroad . In addition
b01-049-02 the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
b01-049-03 speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars ,
b01-049-04 hoping for the mark to rise , as has now happened .
b01-049-05 WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
b01-049-06 Germany's massive trading surplus and choke
b01-049-07 off speculation against dollar and pound ?
b01-053-00 That is doubtful . If however , in addition to her new
b01-053-01 good-neighbour gesture , Germany takes a really big
b01-053-02 share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations , the
b01-053-03 world outlook will be brighter . What gives rise
b01-053-04 to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
b01-053-05 other leading Western nations are at long last
b01-053-06 moving towards a solution of currency problems
b01-073-00 The first reaction of the Sudanese
b01-073-01 Government was to denounce the United
b01-073-02 Nations for " negligence and impotence , " and
b01-073-03 to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
b01-073-04 would be taken home . The reaction can be
b01-073-05 understood . The Sudan's concern for its
b01-073-06 men is natural . But this could hardly be
b01-073-07 a # dignified exit . IF the UN is
b01-073-08 blamed for being weak , it would be
b01-073-09 more logical to send in more men ,
b01-073-10 not weaken it further by desertion .
b01-079-00 It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
b01-079-01 Hammarskjold and the UN's servants . The
b01-079-02 responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
b01-079-03 which have undertaken the task of pre-
b01-079-04 serving peace in the Congo . That is not a
b01-079-05 ceremonial duty , and the soldiers have every
b01-079-06 right to blame the politicians unless they see
b01-079-07 it through . When the United Nations instructed
b01-079-08 Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
b01-079-09 prevent civil war , it was clear that new dangers
b01-079-10 would arise unless it gave him the political ...
b01-084-00 That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
b01-084-01 made . India has responded handsomely by providing
b01-084-02 3,000 men , who must take about a fortnight to arrive .
b01-084-03 If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground ,
b01-084-04 such incidents as that at Matadi would not
b01-084-05 happen . THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
b01-084-06 simply on adequate support by the nations
b01-084-07 which have set their hands to this plough .
b01-089-00 The big Powers involved in the Cold War
b01-089-01 must of course keep out . The Americans were
b01-089-02 justified in diverting naval ships in case
b01-089-03 non-combatant help was wanted ; but they
b01-089-04 stressed that there was no intention to intervene
b01-089-05 in fighting . Yesterday the ships turned away
b01-089-06 again , satisfied that they were not required .
b01-089-07 It is to be hoped that the UN will be
b01-089-08 re-established in their port by negotiation
b01-089-09 and that there will be no more outrages .
b01-094-00 But back , Mr. Hammarskjold is determined ,
b01-094-01 they must go . The best news for the Congo
b01-094-02 would be agreement between its rival
b01-094-03 political leaders . Through the patient efforts
b01-094-04 of UN conciliators they are meeting for
b01-094-05 the first time , in Malagasy ( formerly
b01-094-06 Madagascar ) . THE world will sigh with
b01-094-07 relief when this strife-torn land gets
b01-094-08 itself a government which all outsiders
b01-113-00 ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
b01-113-01 as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as " a
b01-113-02 policy of good neighbourliness . " We may be sure that
b01-113-03 he is not being hypocritical . That is what he
b01-113-04 really believes . A good neighbour to those Africans
b01-113-05 who , under apartheid , will be forced back to
b01-113-06 their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
b01-113-07 cramped and primitive existence .
b01-118-00 A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
b01-118-01 tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
b01-118-02 water in the white areas of South Africa , without rights
b01-118-03 and without hope . THE same sort of good neighbour
b01-118-04 that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
b01-118-05 Hitler in the thirties . It was Dr. Verwoerd who
b01-118-06 led a protest against admitting any of them
b01-118-07 because they would " defile " the national
b01-122-00 It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
b01-122-01 woerd in his nightmare world . It is this that
b01-122-02 makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
b01-122-03 fluenced to change course . The Archbishop of
b01-122-04 Capetown , Dr. Joost de Blank , has pleaded that
b01-122-05 South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
b01-122-06 Commonwealth . Otherwise , he says , those inside the
b01-122-07 country who still oppose apartheid will be
b01-122-08 left even more isolated and alone .
b01-127-00 The views of the Archbishop , who has
b01-127-01 maintained an unflinching witness to what
b01-127-02 Christianity really means , must carry weight . But
b01-127-03 what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries
b01-127-04 do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
b01-127-05 minority ? THERE is no evidence that the
b01-127-06 policy of appeasement has modified the
b01-127-07 actions of the Nationalists . On the contrary ,
b01-127-08 apartheid is being applied ever more
b01-132-00 The shock of expulsion from the
b01-132-01 Commonwealth now seems to be the only
b01-132-02 way left to try to bring home to the people of
b01-132-03 South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
b01-132-04 to disaster . It may be that the Commonwealth
b01-132-05 Prime Ministers will decide against this final
b01-132-06 step . If that is their decision they should also
b01-132-07 go unequivocally on record that they regard
b01-132-08 apartheid as evil and indefensible .
b01-136-00 Unless they do at least that , Dr. Verwoerd will
b01-136-01 be able to return home claiming a triumph .
b01-136-02 His smile will be blander than ever . WE are in
b01-136-03 for it again : another Royal Wedding . Between
b01-136-04 now and June , when the Duke of Kent will
b01-136-05 marry Miss Worsley , hardly a day will pass
b01-136-06 without a story or a picture or probably both ,
b01-136-07 about the nuptial arrangements .
b02-013-00 What seems certain is that those who
b02-013-01 advocate putting off any approach until
b02-013-02 Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
b02-013-03 of heart ( whatever that may mean ) would
b02-013-04 have us run risks greater than the West
b02-013-05 ought to run - and greater than President
b02-013-06 Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
b02-013-07 disposed to face . The real question is
b02-013-08 what we should put to the Soviet
b02-013-09 Government as a basis for talks : and
b02-035-00 On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
b02-035-01 manoeuvring , and what we should call
b02-035-02 cool-headed and inventive negotiation , is
b02-035-03 a means not to destruction but to safety .
b02-035-04 The Government's pompous little statement
b02-035-05 on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,
b02-035-06 but it says what is necessary - that
b02-035-07 the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
b02-035-08 open to revision . This is news , however
b02-035-09 much the Government tries to disguise
b02-035-10 it by saying that the revision would be
b02-045-00 Formula One , which appeared in February , appeared to make
b02-045-01 this likely ; Formula Two , which appeared in June , made it
b02-045-02 very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original
b02-045-03 principle , that is all that need be required of it . It is a pity
b02-045-04 that the Government should ever have been led away
b02-045-05 from this principle . It is a great pity that the
b02-045-06 Government should give the appearance of responding , not
b02-045-07 to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations , but to
b02-045-08 the violence which he tried to prevent .
b02-097-00 To be able to say " New York next week " is an
b02-097-01 important advance . We must not be overconfident
b02-097-02 that this # meeting will lead on to further
b02-097-03 and decisive ones ; but without it , we could not
b02-097-04 look for them . Federal Germany votes tomorrow
b02-097-05 and not a day too soon . There can seldom have
b02-097-06 been an election campaign which more people
b02-097-07 in and out of the country wanted to see over
b02-102-00 To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
b02-102-01 millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
b02-102-02 efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
b02-102-03 the Berlin crisis . It need not have been such a burden
b02-102-04 if Western Governments had not been convinced
b02-102-05 that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
b02-102-06 Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor .
b02-105-00 But they were so convinced and they
b02-105-01 have had to take the consequences . Mean-
b02-105-02 while in Germany itself the course of
b02-105-03 the campaign has dismayed a good
b02-105-04 many people : they too will be glad
b02-105-05 when the polling stations close .
b03-025-00 But discussion on current points of east-west con-
b03-025-01 flict could not go much farther than , for example , the
b03-025-02 truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
b03-025-03 cannot be followed together . What the council has done -
b03-025-04 and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
b03-025-05 tact across the greatest political barrier in what
b03-025-06 is not yet a unitary world .
b03-087-00 The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
b03-087-01 agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is
b03-087-02 short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private
b03-087-03 Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give
b03-087-04 the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
b03-092-00 Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable . They should not ,
b03-092-01 however , disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of
b03-092-02 parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run .
b03-092-03 Centigrade v. Fahrenheit . The fight is on . The challenger has behind
b03-092-04 it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
b03-092-05 but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
b03-098-00 The press and the broadcasting authorities are
b03-098-01 asked to help . To begin with , both tempe-
b03-098-02 ratures will be put in the ring together .
b03-098-03 SIR GRAHAM SUTTON , however , made no bones
b03-098-04 about it yesterday . The purpose is to give
b03-098-05 fahrenheit the knock out . The backers of
b03-098-06 centigrade would have got off to a better
b03-098-07 start if they had taken more pains to
b03-098-08 explain the advantages to the general
b03-104-00 It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
b03-104-01 at the moment " an awful mess up " in
b03-104-02 the measurement of temperatures . This ,
b03-104-03 however , seems a matter of the convenience
b03-104-04 of specialists . The ordinary British man
b03-104-05 and woman is conscious of no difficulty .
b03-104-06 Rather than fifty million people having
b03-104-07 to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there
b03-104-08 any reason why the centigrade countries
b03-104-09 should not change to fahrenheit ?
b03-109-00 Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
b03-109-01 strably better than the other ? The centigraders may
b03-109-02 be in for a stiffer fight than they think . They may
b03-109-03 have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market .
b03-109-04 Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
b03-109-05 public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
b03-109-06 circumstances the time would come when this would
b03-109-07 suit their convenience - rather than to change their
b03-109-08 system of recording temperatures .
b03-114-00 In any case , fahrenheit need not lose heart .
b03-114-01 Once before , and that not so long ago , the
b03-114-02 authorities ganged up to alter the habits
b03-114-03 of the people . That effort was to enforce
b03-114-04 the adoption of the twenty-four hour
b03-114-05 clock . Then , also , the B.B.C. were
b03-114-06 roped in . The only result was
b03-114-07 that the well-meaning corporation
b03-114-08 became very unpopular .
b04-000-00 A BAFFLED and bewildered little country
b04-000-01 stands at the centre of an international
b04-000-02 storm . Belgium is accused - without a
b04-000-03 scrap of evidence - of being implicated in
b04-000-04 the murder of Patrice Lumumba . Her
b04-000-05 leaders are insulted , her embassies are
b04-000-06 attacked in a score of countries .
b04-004-00 In Ghana , President Nkrumah , who
b04-004-01 has done more than most to stir up
b04-004-02 trouble in the Congo , orders every Belgian
b04-004-03 citizen to quit his country . HOUNDING
b04-004-04 Belgium has become an international
b04-004-05 pastime . Why ? Because those who
b04-004-06 said the Congolese could govern themselves
b04-004-07 will not admit they were wrong . So
b04-004-08 Belgium , bowed down by internal
b04-004-09 troubles , mourning a terrible air crash ,
b04-004-10 is made their scapegoat .
b04-010-00 Who will speak for Belgium ? Who else but
b04-010-01 Britain . We have fought beside Belgium
b04-010-02 in two world wars . We are allies still .
b04-010-03 Britain should champion Belgium . Not
b04-010-04 with the careful , hooded language of diplomacy ,
b04-010-05 but boldly and fearlessly . It is time to
b04-010-06 show the world that this country does not
b04-010-07 desert her friends . HAPPY , happy
b04-010-08 families ! Never before have Britain's
b04-010-09 larders been so well stocked .
b04-020-00 Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
b04-020-01 substantially higher last year than in 1959 .
b04-020-02 Lucky , lucky housewives ! To have such a
b04-020-03 splendid variety of goods to choose from .
b04-020-04 Not so long ago older folk were reminding
b04-020-05 young wives , # harassed by
b04-020-06 shortages , of the good old days of
b04-020-07 abundance . Now it is mother who
b04-020-08 picks up recipes from # her daughter .
b04-026-00 The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in
b04-026-01 Britain today ! " THIS is colour day , " proclaimed the American
b04-026-02 television network , N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its
b04-026-03 programmes in bright colours . In America colour TV is five years
b04-026-04 old . There are already 600,000 sets in use . What about Britain ?
b04-026-05 The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service , but the
b04-026-06 commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years .
b04-034-00 The Government should settle this argument with two words to
b04-034-01 the B.B.C. : - Go ahead ! ONE man beyond all others is saddened
b04-034-02 by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
b04-034-03 they had to leave their cottage . Mr. John Crabb , clerk to
b04-034-04 Newmarket urban council , says : " I shall always feel this as a
b04-040-00 There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself . The
b04-040-01 sisters had to quit as their home was falling down . And Mr. Crabb
b04-040-02 did his best for them , even driving them to a new house . John
b04-040-03 Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding . Too
b04-040-04 often lacking in officialdom . MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton
b04-040-05 does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman .
b04-047-00 He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
b04-047-01 be in England . The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
b04-047-02 Scot . The Lord Chancellor is a Scot . The Prime Minister is a
b04-047-03 Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century .
b04-047-04 Let Mr. Newton beware . By protesting against Scotland he
b04-054-00 ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial .
b04-054-01 His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
b04-054-02 five years . During this period Britain will be expected
b04-054-03 to subsidise and defend the Cypriots . They will enjoy
b04-054-04 all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference . It is a
b04-054-05 safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
b04-060-00 It is equally certain that the British Government
b04-060-01 will welcome them . How splendid it would be if , just
b04-060-02 for once , the Government were to voice the real feelings of
b04-060-03 the British people . And tell Makarios they are not
b04-060-04 prepared to accept him on such terms . GOOD cheer
b04-060-05 for the week-end . Ford Motors are to put 13,000
b04-060-06 men back on a five-day week .
b04-066-00 One more demonstration of the industry's recovery . As
b04-066-01 springtime approaches , orders pick up . And the car men get
b04-066-02 ready for another bustling season . The pessimists
b04-066-03 said the motor industry was on its knees . The optimists
b04-066-04 said " Nonsense . " As usual , the optimists have been
b04-066-05 proved right . EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
b04-066-06 hit on an original way of spending this afternoon .
b04-075-00 They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence . It is
b04-075-01 their protest against the H-bomb . They ought to have a
b04-075-02 pleasant time . The weather forecast is good ; except for them ,
b04-075-03 Whitehall should be deserted . And they will have a fine view
b04-075-04 of St. James's Park , with its placid lake , pelicans ,
b04-075-05 rare ducks , and other wild life .
b04-081-00 Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today ?
b04-081-01 Head for the parks to enjoy the sun . Not in
b04-081-02 a foolish cause , but in a glorious one . Good health !
b04-081-03 THIS group of men , says a report , work on average
b04-081-04 between 55 and 60 hours a week . They also put
b04-081-05 in an extra two or three evenings . And they never
b04-089-00 Who are they ? The trade union officials of Britain .
b04-089-01 Men who earn only a fraction of what their
b04-089-02 talents and responsibilities could bring in the open
b04-089-03 labour market . The unions are fortunate indeed to
b04-089-04 find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices . But it is
b04-089-05 time the members decided to pay up and be good
b04-089-06 employers . THE Labour Party says that the Tory
b04-089-07 Government is destroying the social services .
b04-096-00 Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
b04-096-01 national income was spent on social services . The
b04-096-02 present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
b04-096-03 worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity
b04-096-04 to aim at the wrong one ! MRS. MARCIA POWER ,
b04-096-05 whose husband made her clean his uniform , wins
b04-096-06 a divorce . The judge says she had to act almost
b04-103-00 Up and down the country husbands will be saying
b04-103-01 they would never behave like that . But do they ever
b04-103-02 ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
b04-103-03 returned to the shed ; their books tidied ; and often ,
b04-103-04 even their shoes cleaned ? How wonderful if they
b04-103-05 showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
b04-103-06 box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers !
b04-107-00 HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
b04-107-01 in Rhodesia ! Eighteen months ago this territory
b04-107-02 was peaceful , orderly , and thriving . Africans within the
b04-107-03 Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
b04-107-04 administration . Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
b04-107-05 Secretary . Suddenly everything changed . Timetables were
b04-107-06 scrapped . The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
b04-107-07 rushed out to Rhodesia . Overnight , minor African
b04-107-08 politicians were inflated into international figures .
b04-116-00 And as the British Government stepped up the pace
b04-116-01 of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands .
b04-116-02 TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has
b04-116-03 caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened .
b04-116-04 No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching .
b04-116-05 If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
b04-116-06 Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
b04-116-07 difficulties from African politicians greedy for power .
b04-121-00 But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
b04-121-01 be plunged into chaos , like the Congo . For Mr.
b04-121-02 Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice . They
b04-121-03 must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos . And try to
b04-121-04 repair the damage they have done . WHO can grow the
b04-121-05 fastest ? That is the exciting competition going on
b04-121-06 among Britain's major industries .
b04-128-00 Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry .
b04-128-01 Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel .
b04-128-02 Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
b04-128-03 tremendous upsurge in investment . It reports that new
b04-128-04 factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
b04-128-05 up on 1960 . Britain's business men are right to back
b04-134-00 For expansion today means still greater
b04-134-01 prosperity tomorrow . BERTRAND RUSSELL ,
b04-134-02 the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
b04-134-03 the-Bomb crusade , has devoted following .
b04-134-04 Thousands march with him - and sit with him
b04-134-05 too . It is said by some that he is a saint ; by
b04-134-06 others that he is a prophet . He is , in fact , a
b04-134-07 philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
b04-134-08 who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
b04-140-00 BEFORE the war he urged the British people
b04-140-01 to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists .
b04-140-02 After the war he favoured a preventive war against
b04-140-03 Russia . Now he wants Britain to demolish her
b04-140-04 defences . Throughout the years Lord Russell
b04-140-05 and his supporters have been able to pursue their
b04-140-06 eccentric campaigns in freedom . They should
b04-140-07 ask themselves this question : How long would
b04-140-08 that freedom last if their policies were adopted ?
b04-147-00 AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
b04-147-01 Board . The board is laying a cable along a seven-
b04-147-02 mile route in Surrey . A warden , Mr. Jack Finlay ,
b04-147-03 has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
b04-147-04 householders when trenches are dug outside their
b04-147-05 front gates . Splendid . By showing concern
b04-147-06 for the people the board will earn their good will .
b04-147-07 Happy patrolling , Mr. Finlay !
b04-154-00 GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky ! The tough ,
b04-154-01 resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
b04-154-02 shakes the life out of his critics . He calls them
b04-154-03 " jelly-boned . " He promises to preserve federation
b04-154-04 against African fanatics and woolly minded
b04-154-05 individuals in the West . Some may ask : Is
b04-154-06 Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
b04-154-07 disagree with him ? The facts answer that .
b04-162-00 CONTRAST his firm , successful rule in Rhodesia
b04-162-01 with what has happened in the Congo . There
b04-162-02 Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
b04-162-03 into practice . There a UNO army of Africans ,
b04-162-04 bossed by an Indian , has been in charge for
b04-162-05 months . And what has it made of the Congo ?
b04-162-06 A bloodstained shambles . No wonder
b04-162-07 Welensky has lost all patience with his
b04-169-00 They have earned his strictures . And his
b04-169-01 contempt . SOME people are for ever complaining
b04-169-02 that teenagers earn too much and spend it all
b04-169-03 when they get it . Now a survey of the Post
b04-169-04 Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that
b04-169-05 idea is . The biggest group of depositors in
b04-169-06 the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15
b04-175-00 Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before .
b04-175-01 Certainly they spend more . But how splendid
b04-175-02 that in the most prosperous days in this
b04-175-03 country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift
b04-175-04 should still have a powerful appeal for young
b04-175-05 people . THE Danes are annoyed with British
b04-175-06 farmers for fighting against Danish competition .
b04-175-07 They say that our farmers do not seem to
b04-175-08 understand the meaning of free trade .
b04-181-00 There is no doubt what the Danes understand
b04-181-01 by free trade . It is that they should be free
b04-181-02 to sell as much as they like , while buying
b04-181-03 more and more from our rivals . Germany has
b04-181-04 now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
b04-181-05 principal supplier . The farmers of Britain
b04-181-06 understand free trade . That is why they fight
b04-187-00 THE Palace cinema at Buckley , near Chester , will be
b04-187-01 reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric
b04-187-02 Platt , both aged 19 . Eric says : " We believe in the
b04-187-03 cinema . And we know what people want . " The
b04-187-04 combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation
b04-187-05 of public taste has launched many great
b04-187-06 enterprises . Barry and Eric have enthusiasm . They
b04-187-07 are backed by a resurgent film industry .
b04-195-00 It could be curtain up on two success stories . Of
b04-195-01 the old Palace . And Barry and Eric . DONS at
b04-195-02 Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
b04-195-03 an honours degree course . Farming is Britain's
b04-195-04 most vital industry . It is increasingly dependent
b04-195-05 on new techniques - and on the universities to
b04-195-06 provide men of knowledge and skill .
b04-202-00 The older universities are often accused of being
b04-202-01 interested only in dead subjects . Now Cambridge has
b04-202-02 the opportunity to show is just as interested in the
b04-202-03 living . Particularly as its rival , Oxford , has had a
b04-202-04 similar course in farming for 15 years !
b04-202-05 JOHN GLENN , Virgil Grissom , Alan Shepard . One of
b04-202-06 these three men has a date with destiny - the
b04-208-00 At the beginning of this wonderful century many
b04-208-01 people believed that there were no more worlds to
b05-017-00 Nobody 's going to shove 2ole Uncle Sam around ! " He then
b05-017-01 took out a piece of paper , wrote his address on it and added :
b05-017-02 " Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me
b05-017-03 first . I won't stand for it . " Exit a puzzled American .
b05-017-04 The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg
b05-032-00 The travellers from the New World who had
b05-032-01 been in Britain many times before , were
b05-032-02 slightly stunned . Afterwards they said : " We thought
b05-032-03 we knew it all , but you Britishers never run
b05-032-05 To the British Travel Association , doing their excellent
b05-032-06 darndest , I offer these sad complexities . IN the 1830's
b05-032-07 the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
b05-032-08 many a good trade unionist since then has , in the
b05-032-09 hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers , taken
b05-032-10 the theoretical Luddite hammer again .
b05-038-00 Hence the hostility to automation and
b05-038-01 the stop-watch manufacturing methods that
b05-038-02 have # led to restrictive practices . Now a new
b05-038-03 threat to those who toil and spin has been
b05-038-04 developed by a firm specialising in electronics
b05-038-05 in Los Angeles . They have developed a new
b05-038-06 system whereby completely untrained workers
b05-038-07 can be taught their trade by means of tape
b05-038-08 recordings and television .
b05-042-00 What happens is that the unskilled worker
b05-042-01 is processed , by high-speed listening to recorded
b05-042-02 instructions on how to do the job coupled with
b05-042-03 explanatory TV pictures , into becoming a highly
b05-042-04 skilled , obedient craftsman in no time at all .
b05-042-05 Not only can the raw human mind be
b05-042-06 technically equipped very quickly to do one
b05-042-07 set of skilled manufacturing processes in one
b05-042-08 trade but , by being given another of the new
b05-042-09 audio-TV training techniques , he can be switched
b05-042-10 to a different industry if he just gives in and
b05-045-00 From being an assembler in an aircraft
b05-045-01 factory to becoming a paint sprayer in
b05-045-02 a ceramic factory , he can be qualified
b05-045-03 for a completely new job in less time
b05-045-04 than it takes to say " Tolpuddle
b05-045-05 Martyrs ! " " CRICKET , " says the Oxford
b05-045-06 Dictionary , is " an open air game played
b05-045-07 with ball , bats and wickets between
b05-045-08 # two sides consisting of eleven players
b05-045-09 each . " Not so , dear Oxford Dictionary .
b05-050-00 You are out of date . Cricket in 1961 is played
b05-050-01 with a theodolite , six surveyors , a ball ;
b05-050-02 bats and wickets between two sides . Shades
b05-050-03 of the village stalwarts of Hambledon who
b05-050-04 are now the patron saints of the game !
b05-050-05 What would THEY have thought of
b05-050-06 these civil engineers creeping about
b05-050-07 the pitch with their optical
b05-055-00 The village green is the real home of cricket . A couple of bumps
b05-055-01 on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout
b05-055-02 heart , a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for
b05-055-03 batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a
b05-055-04 mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer .
b05-058-00 They 'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next .
b05-058-01 EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the
b05-058-02 German mind . Not content with arguing that he was only an
b05-058-03 efficient cog in the machine , he now claims that part of the
b05-058-04 endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
b05-062-00 He feels satisfaction " from the fact that my personality had been
b05-062-01 tested and weighed and not found wanting . " He feels like
b05-062-02 Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude
b05-062-03 saying : " I am innocent of the blood of this just person . "
b05-062-04 Like Dr. Globke , whom I interviewed the other day , Eichmann
b05-067-00 " I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I
b05-067-01 could despite my low rank . " Eichmann is on dangerous ground
b05-067-02 when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
b05-067-03 of the triangle that led to Hitler , Himmler , Hess and Goering
b05-067-04 at the apex . In examination he betrayed an expert and
b05-067-05 intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
b05-071-00 He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and
b05-071-01 meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man
b05-071-02 who used the system - and used it with power and authority .
b05-071-03 The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them-
b05-071-04 selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are
g05-098-00 So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
g05-098-01 " Werewolves " that we had contemplated the necessity of very
g05-098-02 special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen . Particular
g05-098-03 hatred , we felt , was bound to be aimed at the representatives of
g05-098-04 those who had , over the years , spread such ghastly havoc , destruction
g05-098-05 and death over Germany , causing such wholesale slaughter among
g05-098-06 men , women and children , old and young alike .
h05-012-00 5 . Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission
h05-012-01 are highway payments , clearance payments ( for clearing remains of
h05-012-02 structures from " total loss " sites ) and church payments . Although
h05-012-03 differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
h05-012-04 works payments , the sums paid under these heads have the
h05-012-05 common feature that they are all payments in respect of works
b05-074-00 They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
b05-074-01 was an iniquitous injustice . When they burst into
b05-074-02 Czechoslovakia , Poland , Holland , Belgium and France
b05-074-03 they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
b05-074-04 them that they were being " encircled . " They really
b05-074-05 believed in the moral superiority of " The New
b05-074-06 Order " which Himmler on October 4 , 1943 , expressed
b05-074-07 thus : " Whether nations live in prosperity or starve
b05-074-08 to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
b05-074-09 need them as slaves to # our Kultur ; otherwise
b05-074-10 it is of no interest to me .
g05-094-00 The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
g05-094-01 more than a fantasy . Thanks to the good
g05-094-02 sense of the front line soldiers , the
g05-094-03 meeting of East and West was marked by
g05-094-04 the use of no weapon more lethal than
g05-094-05 vodka . And the effect on the German people
g05-094-06 of the first ten years of the promised
g05-094-07 thousand of Nazi rule , so far from creating
g05-094-08 a spirit of warlike frenzy , had produced
g05-094-09 universally a dull bewildered apathy .
b05-079-00 This concept of slavery included Britain .
b05-079-01 General Brauchitsch signed a directive
b05-079-02 ordering that after the successful
b05-079-03 invasion of our islands all the " able-bodied
b05-079-04 male population between the ages of
b05-079-05 seventeen and forty-five will , unless the
b05-079-06 local situation calls for an exceptional
b05-079-07 ruling , be interned and dispatched to the
b05-079-08 Continent . " The Baltic States were
b05-079-09 to have been our destination .
b05-083-00 In no other conquered country , not even
b05-083-01 Poland , had the Germans begun with such a
b05-083-02 drastic step . There is no doubt that the compatriots
b05-083-03 of Eichmann would have been as good as their
b05-083-04 evil word . THE Inland Revenue people have a
b05-083-05 thankless task . But they do not make
b05-083-06 themselves less disliked by their attitude
b05-083-07 to their customers - who incidentally
b05-083-08 pay their salaries .
b05-098-00 It was called " Abou Ben Adhem and the
b05-098-01 Angel . " I don't know why I was so
b05-098-02 impressed with this poem but , on re-
b05-098-03 flection , it might be that I took a
b05-098-04 guilty interest in the devilment busi-
b05-098-05 ness . I may well have felt that I was
b05-098-06 hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian
b05-098-07 upbringing and a possible reprieve might
b05-098-08 come through the sugary sentiments
b05-098-09 of " Abou Ben Adhem . "
b05-088-00 Their demands are invariably couched in
b05-088-01 hectoring , out-of-date language , but in spite of all
b05-088-02 their bluster , they let many a big fish through the
b05-088-03 net while they are bullying the minnows . I have just
b05-088-04 heard a good example of their officious efficiency .
b05-088-05 A young chap I know got his first job last week . He
b05-088-06 is paid monthly in arrears and will not get
b05-088-07 a bean for the next twenty-one days .
b06-000-00 SOME 17 years ago , in the early summer of 1934 ,
b06-000-01 the German ambassador in London was dictating
b06-000-02 a secret report to his chief von Papen , in Berlin .
b06-000-03 " Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion
b06-000-04 of German rearmament , in opposition , to France . "
b06-000-05 Later that year he warned that Britain knew
b06-000-06 Germany was breaking the agreement to stop
b06-000-07 building bombers , and added :
b06-023-00 Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
b06-023-01 Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
b06-023-02 up . These " fighters " are in fact fighter bombers
b06-023-03 which could launch an atomic attack on
b06-023-04 Eastern Europe . By 1963 the Germans plan to have
b06-023-05 nine missile battalions , with 288 missiles and
b06-023-06 36 firing ramps , including weapons like Matador
b06-023-07 ( range 950 miles ) , also provided by the Americans .
b06-097-00 This week of window dressing will not prevent
b06-097-01 most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school
b06-097-02 in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley
b06-097-03 jobs . It needs more than 10,000 church parades
b06-097-04 and open days at techs , more than descents into
b06-097-05 Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
b06-097-06 Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to
b06-097-07 catch up with the space age .
c06-039-00 Among other incidents he was banned from New
c06-039-01 York's St. Patrick's Day parade as a " disorderly
c06-039-02 person . " He was in a fight after telling a
c06-039-03 Canadian , during a chat about space-flight :
c06-039-04 " Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit , Israel
c06-039-05 will put a matzo ball into orbit , and Lichtenstein
c06-039-06 will put a postage stamp into orbit before you
c06-039-07 Canadians put up a mouse . "
c06-100-00 So all ends as you know it will , with the
c06-100-01 middle-aged romancers respectably wed and
c06-100-02 Master Darin going steady with the delectable
c06-100-03 Sandra Dee ( to whom , I believe , he is married
c06-100-04 in real life ) . Miss Dee , incidentally , who keeps
c06-100-05 turning up as the typical teenager in all the
c06-100-06 " good girl " parts ( Tuesday Weld gets the " bad girl "
c06-100-07 ones ) , is becoming quite an accomplished actress .
b06-004-00 " Without Britain's tolerance German rearma-
b06-004-01 ment in the air would be jeopardised . " When
b06-004-02 Hoesch's reports , along with other nazi documents ,
b06-004-03 were captured and published after the war the
b06-004-04 pattern of British Government connivance became
b06-004-05 clear . At nazi Germany's request , Britain was
b06-004-06 providing the cloak for Germany to build an
b06-004-07 air force bigger than that of France .
b06-049-00 When Scarborough carried our point of view
b06-049-01 we were naturally delighted , more so because
b06-049-02 the alternatives had been put clearly to the
b06-049-03 movement , which had then chosen a vigorous
b06-049-04 anti-Nato , anti-Tory , anti-bomb and anti-German
b06-049-05 rearmament policy . Hopes rose as we saw a
b06-049-06 perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
b06-049-07 lines of difference with the Tories . Many members
b06-049-08 understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
b06-049-09 of the union would become easier in the context
b06-075-00 At the same time that unity cannot be
b06-075-01 established on a false basis , or by creating
b06-075-02 further confusion within the movement . Unity
b06-075-03 will never be established on the basis of leaders
b06-075-04 being a law unto themselves and opposing
b06-075-05 conference decisions when it suits their own
b06-075-06 convenience . Unity can never be established by
b06-075-07 any formula uniting those who oppose German
b06-075-08 troops being trained on British soil and Polaris ,
b06-075-09 and those who are for this policy - which is the
b06-075-10 same as that of the Tory Government .
c06-111-00 This sort of situation calls for some subtle ,
c06-111-01 slightly sardonic handling . It doesn't get it . But
c06-111-02 The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
c06-111-03 time . I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced
c06-111-04 Studies attached to some American universities
c06-111-05 the subject Social Psychology used to be called
c06-111-06 Home-making and is now known as Domestic
b06-008-00 Yesterday West German Defence Minister ,
b06-008-01 Herr Strauss , started talks with the British
b06-008-02 Defence Minister , Mr. Watkinson . Their talks
b06-008-03 are another stage in the cloak operation ,
b06-008-04 1961 variety , by which the West German
b06-008-05 militarists are advancing their rearmament .
b06-008-06 Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
b06-008-07 that his policy was to make his country
b06-008-08 the " strongest militarily in Europe and the
b06-008-09 United States' principal Nato ally . "
b06-056-00 They obstructed every effort to fight for the
b06-056-01 Scarborough decisions , while # scratching
b06-056-02 around frantically to overturn them next
b06-056-03 time . Confusion of the original issue
b06-056-04 by misrepresentation of the decisions ,
b06-056-05 the introduction of a pseudo third way
b06-056-06 and the call for party unity - in effect ,
b06-056-07 a demand that the movement unite
b06-056-08 with the Gaitskellites on their policy
b06-056-09 and no other seems to have done the
b06-056-10 trick of moving a number of unions
b06-093-00 This should strengthen the campaign to
b06-093-01 end the manufacture and use of
b06-093-02 nuclear weapons in Britain . Britain then
b06-093-03 could play a leading and independent
b06-093-04 role for an international agreement to ban
b06-093-05 all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
b06-093-06 destruction , and lay the basis for real
b06-093-07 peace and progress . WHEN all the
b06-093-08 ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
b06-093-09 Week subsides it is doubtful whether more
b06-093-10 than a handful of new apprenticeships
c06-005-00 Where the 2bhoys are . In the hallway are
c06-005-01 the empties ; through the door hearts are
c06-005-02 full , hopes are high . There are still a few
c06-005-03 amber inches in the bottle . Present are some
c06-005-04 hard-core Friends of Brendan . They listen
c06-005-05 with many an obliging guffaw to the
c06-005-06 brandy owner's solo swish on his anecdotal
c06-005-07 roller-coaster , with occasional stops for an old
c06-005-08 I.R.A. air or a Connemara tear-jerker .
c06-020-00 That 's as bloody silly as calling a Rolls-
c06-020-01 Royce a type of transport . She 's the
c06-020-02 flower in a cultural desert . " Now , me - I 'm
c06-020-03 a journalist , I write to entertain rather
c06-020-04 than educate . And I don't write at all
c06-020-05 unless I 'm exceedingly 2skint . " But I 'll
c06-020-06 say this . I 'd like to live in America
c06-020-07 and do some writing there .
b06-012-00 His job is to build up the military apparatus which
b06-012-01 will back West Germany's economic domination of Western
b06-012-02 Europe through the Common Market . He continued this week
b06-012-03 the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a
b06-012-04 Nato council meeting last year over the question : do we
b06-012-05 fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war ?
b06-036-00 Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained
b06-036-01 and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in
b06-036-02 control . Nato , far from being a means of controlling
b06-036-03 the German militarists , is , in fact , the cover for
b06-036-04 building up their power . What must Britain do ? Today ,
b06-036-05 again , she has a key role . Let her tell men like Strauss
b06-036-06 that he shall have no bases or " facilities , " no help in
b06-110-00 But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
b06-110-01 prefer unskilled jobs . Countless numbers who want training
b06-110-02 are denied it . One area electricity board in 1958
b06-110-03 offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
b06-110-04 applications , of whom 100 were considered suitable by
b06-110-05 the board . There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
b06-110-06 boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth
c06-052-00 What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded
c06-052-01 by his publishers in March of last year ? Still a skeleton . Yet
c06-052-02 I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of
c06-052-03 a book planned to be called Confessions of an Irish
c06-052-04 Rebel which was delivered to his agents in June . IT
c06-052-05 begins : " There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's
c06-052-06 return from her abortion in Bristol . "
c06-087-01 Inevitably there comes the time when Mr. Hudson suddenly breaks
c06-087-02 with tradition and arrives there in July , when , just as
c06-087-03 inevitably , the place is full of American teenagers on an
c06-087-04 escorted tour . Result : Mr. Hudson and lady love Lollo find
c06-087-05 themselves playing chaperon ( Brenda de Banzie , the official
c06-087-06 one , has broken a leg ) to the girls , who have just
c06-087-07 been joined by a Jeep-load of boys .
b06-015-00 A 90-day war , the West German
b06-015-01 view , provides the pretext for huge
b06-015-02 German armed forces ( within Nato
b06-015-03 of course ) and for those to have
b06-015-04 bases all over Western Europe .
b06-015-05 In the past year West Germany
b06-015-06 has secured agreements for
b06-015-07 " facilities " in France , Holland and
b06-015-08 Belgium . After much bargaining
b06-015-09 the British Government has
b06-015-10 agreed to give similar " facilities "
b06-053-00 For we have always felt , even
b06-053-01 if we have then by our practice
b06-053-02 ignored it , the inconsistency
b06-053-03 between support for the war
b06-053-04 alliance , with resulting colossal
b06-053-05 spending on armaments , and our
b06-053-06 basic effort to improve living
b06-053-07 standards . Instead , we saw the
b06-053-08 Gaitskellites using the position
b06-053-09 of organisational dominance
b06-053-10 established during their years
c06-106-00 The girl is a knock-out ( see pic-
c06-106-01 ture of Julie Newmar for con-
c06-106-02 firmation ) . She also has quite a
c06-106-03 mission in mind . She , " younger ,
c06-106-04 prettier , stronger , and more
c06-106-05 intelligent " than the wife ( as she
c06-106-06 soon tells her ) , wants to have the
c06-106-07 perfect baby . And she has chosen
c06-106-08 the husband ( James Mason ) , who
c06-106-09 is an academic friend of her
c06-106-10 Nobel prize-winning father to be
b06-019-00 The process has been too slow for Herr
b06-019-01 Strauss and last month he attacked
b06-019-02 Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's
b06-019-03 plans for a " unified supply apparatus "

b06-071-04 Gaitskell's stupid hope . The tragedy is

c06-076-02 either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar
c06-076-03 playing a drunk scene , and playing it with
c06-076-04 perfect timing and technique . It gives one loud ,
c06-076-05 clear hiccup and falls flat on its back . This
c06-076-06 brilliant budge , I may add , gets no credit
c06-076-07 in the cast list of Come September ( Odeon ,

c06-128-00 ON a March evening in 1932 in the New
c06-128-01 Jersey family household the nursemaid
c06-128-02 tiptoed into the baby's room to see that
c06-128-03 20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping .
c06-128-04 Bending over the cot , she suddenly realised
c06-128-05 that there was no sound of breathing .
c06-128-06 She thrust out her hand - and felt
c06-128-07 emptiness . A FEW minutes later the father
c06-128-08 gripping a loaded rifle , told his wife :
b06-027-00 Last month West Germany was
b06-027-01 reported to be halfway toward
b06-027-02 this target . Her position as " America's
b06-027-03 principal Nato ally " grows stronger
b06-027-04 and stronger . Now this target which
b06-027-05 Herr Strauss and his fellows
b06-027-06 have their eyes on is control of the
b06-027-07 warheads to these weapons . General

c06-014-01 relief - turns his attention to
c06-014-02 the writing scene . He proceeds to
c06-014-03 place himself in the literary hierarchy .
c06-014-04 " I consider myself , " he says , " a cut
c06-014-05 above Evelyn Waugh socially , a cut
c06-014-06 above Nancy Mitford artistically , a

c06-103-04 look-out that the jokes about
c06-103-05 sex ( what else would they joke
c06-103-06 about with an X ? ) are of the witty ,
c06-103-07 verbal variety and not the visual
c06-103-08 slapstick . This has only one gag -
c06-103-09 that of the entry of a gladiator
c06-138-00 The plain , sober manner of its
c06-138-01 style all the more tellingly
c06-138-02 points up not only the horror
c06-138-03 of the case itself , which
c06-138-04 floundered on to the electrocution
c06-138-05 four years later of a German-
c06-138-06 born Bronx carpenter named
c06-138-07 Bruno Richard Hauptmann , but

c06-138-09 and sensation-hunger of that
b06-032-00 All this has been achieved through Nato under
b06-032-01 American leadership . But a big role has been
b06-032-02 played not only by the British Government but
b06-032-03 by Right-Wing Labour in this country . They have
b06-032-04 helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany ,
b06-032-05 in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet
b06-032-06 policy which brought disaster in 1939 .
b06-059-00 It would become easy to become cynical and
b06-059-01 to despair . And yet , wherever the issues were put
b06-059-02 clearly , sections of the movement reaffirmed their
b06-059-03 original stand . Only where the issues were
b06-059-04 posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
b06-059-05 were positions lost . It is my view that this
b06-059-06 immediate confusion hides the fact that the
b06-059-07 Peace movement is still advancing and that
b06-059-08 clarification of the issues can bring a
b06-059-09 majority to # secure the Scarborough
b06-079-00 It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
b06-079-01 ment to unite the movement as the Labour
b06-079-02 leaders are not only in favour of American
b06-079-03 bases , but are in favour of German bases and
b06-079-04 troops being trained on British soil . The new
b06-079-05 Defence statement , while accepting that Britain can-
b06-079-06 not remain an independent nuclear Power , now
b06-079-07 supports the policy of depending on American
b06-079-08 nuclear weapons and the H-bomb , placing
b06-079-09 Britain in an even more dangerous position .
c06-000-00 IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday . The streets
c06-000-01 are tranquilly sunny and still , for the town
c06-000-02 is at Mass . Most of it . In the front room of
c06-000-03 a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who
c06-000-04 never actually got to church , but who are
c06-000-05 gathered with devotion around Brendan Behan
c06-031-00 I 'm the only man on earth who doesn't know

b06-042-07 which fought for and still stands on the
b06-042-08 policy decisions established at the Scar-
b06-042-09 borough Labour Party Conference I am
b06-042-10 appalled at the character of the current
b06-068-00 All recent events show how correct the
b06-068-01 Scarborough decisions were . The Kennedy
b06-068-02 Administration's sharpened policies , the
b06-068-03 speeded-up drive to improve West
b06-068-04 Germany's armament , the new attempt
b06-068-05 to rush Britain into the European Common
b06-068-06 Market , and the kite-flying on Spain
b06-068-07 present a whole new proof that to abandon
b06-068-08 Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
b06-068-09 working class to sharp new dangers - that
b06-068-10 Gaitskellism is bankrupt .
c06-058-00 It is ribald , funny , brilliantly observant
c06-058-01 of character , and authentic as a glass
c06-058-02 of draught porter . But will we see its
c06-058-03 end ? The last scene of this fragment
c06-058-04 is in a pub where the author throws a
c06-058-05 10 note on to the bar and orders a
c06-058-06 round for the pals , one of whom cries :
c06-095-00 " That 's how I got into all this trouble . "
c06-095-01 " He 's got to be 35 , " says Bobby Darin ,
c06-095-02 the chief spokesman of the jeans-and-
c06-095-03 Jeep brigadiers as they 're scheming to
c06-095-04 get rid of old man , solid Rock . " How
c06-095-05 many hills can he take ? " Of course Mr.
c06-095-06 Hudson can take one more hill than the
b06-045-00 For many years my union had to present its views
b06-045-01 to the two major conferences of the movement and
b06-045-02 take a licking . For us , unity meant accepting
b06-045-03 unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the
b06-045-04 movement and having a go next time . Alongside
b06-045-05 many others , we conducted our fight by putting
b06-045-06 down # unambiguous alternatives to
b06-045-07 official policy and seeking to win majorities
b06-045-08 for them .
b06-082-00 The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
b06-082-01 different in principle to the new defence statement .
b06-082-02 They accept American nuclear bases , and also
b06-082-03 the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
b06-082-04 until some future date . They deceive the people
b06-082-05 by their talk of political and collective control
b06-082-06 of Nato . The Pentagon has made it perfectly
b06-082-07 clear who controls the American H-bomb , and
b06-082-08 who will actually give the instructions to press
b06-082-09 the button for nuclear warfare .
c06-047-00 LESS has been heard of Brendan's work . It is now
c06-047-01 five years since his first play , The Quare Fellow , was
c06-047-02 produced , three years since Borstal Boy was published
c06-047-03 and The Hostage was put on . What has happened to
c06-047-04 the play , Richard's Cork Leg , begun 18 months ago
c06-047-05 and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal ,
c06-047-06 Stratford , last spring ? It was never finished .
c06-091-00 It 's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle , but I
c06-091-01 don't think it was through boredom . The film is funny enough
c06-091-02 in places and has a line or two of painful home truths
c06-091-03 thrown in . " I don't want to talk like an adult , " screams
c06-091-04 Gina , walking out on the man who has so far
c06-091-05 failed to make an honest woman of her .
b06-064-00 Powerful units have stood firm .
b06-064-01 In unions where the central issues
b06-064-02 were confused , clear policy details -
b06-064-03 as on bases - were decisively carried .
b06-064-04 This , and the numbers of active
b06-064-05 workers who are beginning to understand
b06-064-06 how and why the trick was done ,
b06-064-07 provides a strong , immediate basis
b06-064-08 for a campaign against weak and
b06-064-09 doubtful positions , and for a consistent
b06-100-00 The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh ,
b06-100-01 opening a few technical college extensions ,
b06-100-02 will not keep us abreast of the
b06-100-03 scientific revolution . Out of the 550,000
b06-100-04 young people aged 15-17 starting
b06-100-05 work in 1960 420000 ( 73 per cent )
b06-100-06 went into unskilled work . The per-
b06-100-07 centage is expected to swell to 80
b06-100-08 next year . The Duke , possibly
b06-100-09 speaking from experience , stated :
c06-043-00 And he suffered an alcoholic
c06-043-01 seizure and was gravely ill in
c06-043-02 hospital with a diabetic and heart
c06-043-03 condition . His return to Dublin was
c06-043-04 heralded by the announcement that
c06-043-05 he was " off the gargle - a retired
c06-043-06 alcoholic . " Since then he has been
c06-043-07 heard of often in the newspapers -
c06-043-08 three times up before the beaks for
c06-043-09 drunk and disorderly conduct .
c06-080-00 The performance of our talented
c06-080-01 feathered friend is not the only
c06-080-02 good thing ( although the one original
c06-080-03 touch ) in the film , which is better-
c06-080-04 than-average glossy comedy , Hollywood-
c06-080-05 styled , European set . Most of it has
c06-080-06 been shot in and around the
c06-080-07 sun-terrace of the Hotel Splendido ( renamed
c06-080-08 the Dolce Vista for the picture ) in
c06-080-09 Portofino - and if there 's a better view
c06-116-00 Susan Hayward plays the wife sharply
c06-116-01 and sweetly . Mason is always good for
c06-116-02 a glower . And Miss Newmar is a
c06-116-03 stunner in every sense of the word .
c06-116-04 According to the script she was once
c06-116-05 captain of the junior hockey team at
c06-116-06 her school . So help me so was I .
c06-116-07 IL GRIDO ( The Cry ) - Paris Pullman -
c06-116-08 is an earlier essay in atmospheric
c06-116-09 meandering by the L'Avventura man ,
c06-116-10 Michelangelo Antonioni .
b06-087-00 There is only one way to develop unity and
b06-087-01 at the same time defend Britain . This
b06-087-02 was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
b06-087-03 Congress , representing 800,000 organised
b06-087-04 trade unionists , when it decided by overwhelming
b06-087-05 votes , to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions
b06-087-06 on unilateral disarmament , and to oppose
b06-087-07 Polaris and military bases being installed on
b06-087-08 the Holy Loch , or any other part of Britain .
b06-090-00 Such a policy would unite the whole movement
b06-090-01 and lay the basis for the defeat of the
b06-090-02 present Tory Government , which has become a
b06-090-03 real menace to the British people both in
b06-090-04 home and foreign policy . It is quite evident
b06-090-05 that the movement will go on record against
b06-090-06 the Polaris base and facilities for German bases
c01-009-00 The production by Bill Duncalf
c01-009-01 compressed a long and sometimes rambling
c01-009-02 story into a concentrated comprehensive
c01-009-03 survey of a life work . P. J. K. HANS WERNER
c01-009-04 HENZE'S " Elegy for Young Lovers " is the first
c01-009-05 unambiguously " contemporary " work to be
c01-009-06 admitted to the Glyndebourne canon . By no
c01-009-07 means a masterpiece , it is in many respects
c01-009-08 a representative modern work and the composer
c01-009-09 is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
c01-009-10 idioms , with a strong sense of words and situation .
c01-014-00 The libretto , by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman ,
c01-014-01 is largely a satire on the petty court
c01-014-02 surrounding an ageing poet , whose deeply
c01-014-03 egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
c01-014-04 everything to his need of inspiration . Henze
c01-014-05 obtains his musical characterisation by means
c01-014-06 of individual instrumental timbres and " personal "
c01-014-07 intervals , and the result is often less delineation
c01-014-08 of character than caricature . This is also the chief ,
c01-014-09 or at least the most successfully executed trait
c01-014-10 of the libretto , which contains an odd blend of highly
c01-066-00 The evil that Byron did certainly lived after
c01-066-01 him , and was even outmatched by the
c01-066-02 mischief perpetrated by almost every person
c01-066-03 who had been close to him . In turning over
c01-066-04 the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought
c01-066-05 to light a great deal of discreditable
c01-066-06 behaviour and a vision of mischief-
c01-066-07 making propensities of the leisured
c01-066-08 classes in the early 19th century which
c01-066-09 leaves one a little breathless .
c02-000-00 AFTER ten days of intermittent , near fatal
c02-000-01 ennui , the eleventh Berlin International
c02-000-02 Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to
c02-000-03 life by two extraordinary films , Bernhard
c02-000-04 Wicki's " Das Wunder des Malachias " ( " The
c02-000-05 Miracle of Father Malachias " ) and Michael-
c02-000-06 angelo Antonioni's " La Notte . " The num-
c02-000-07 ber of German film directors who have
c02-000-08 made first rate works in the last 25 years
c02-000-09 can be counted on the fingers of one
c02-003-00 It would now seem that Wicki's name must
c02-003-01 be added to this list , for his new film
c02-003-02 may well be a landmark in the revitali-
c02-003-03 sation of the German cinema . Wicki is
c02-003-04 not only a director . He began his career
c02-003-05 as an actor , had his first important
c02-003-07 Bru"cke , " and he also appears in the
c02-007-00 In 1950 he began to take photographs not
c02-007-01 only in Germany but also in Africa and
c02-007-02 America . An exhibition of these works which
c02-007-03 is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-
c02-007-04 pressive . As Friedrich Du"rrenmatt , the Swiss
c02-007-05 playwright and author , wrote : " Wicki's blacks
c02-007-06 and greys are not only the colours of the
c02-007-07 lost and the forgotten , but they are also the
c02-007-08 technical means of abstraction .
c02-017-00 Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
c02-017-01 considerable fidelity , the film tells the story
c02-017-02 of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
c02-017-03 table night club near his church be re-
c02-017-04 moved . One night his prayer is answered
c02-017-05 and the offending establishment is suddenly
c02-017-06 transplanted to an island in the North Sea .
c02-017-07 But Father Malachias's troubles have only
c02-017-08 begun . Instead of having the desired effect ,
c02-017-09 the miracle becomes exploited by a group
c02-012-00 Every unnecessary detail , all superfluous local
c02-012-01 colouring must be eliminated . He does not
c02-012-02 want the accuracy of a police photograph ,
c02-012-03 but rather he wants to show the eternal in
c02-012-04 every instant . " The chilling horror of " Mala-
c02-012-05 chias " is due as much to Wicki the photo-
c02-012-06 grapher as to Wicki the director . His earlier
c02-012-07 film , " Die Bru"cke , " was equally terrifying ,
c02-012-08 but here the director moves out of the world
c02-012-09 of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
c02-022-00 Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
c02-022-01 the missing building . The Church rebukes the
c02-022-02 poor monk for his miracle , and as a
c02-022-03 crowning indignity the night club is
c02-022-04 given a gala society reopening on the
c02-022-05 island . Father Malachias goes to the island ,
c02-022-06 prays , and in a second miracle the
c02-022-07 night club is replaced in its original
c02-026-00 A summary of the story can give almost
c02-026-01 indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry . He
c02-026-02 tells his story best in the faces of his crowds ,
c02-026-03 recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat
c02-026-04 with brutal honesty , building up to a
c02-026-05 tremendous climax in the island orgy .
c02-026-06 Here , the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts ,
c02-026-07 the wildly flapping white sails slashed by
c02-026-08 the glaring beacon of a lighthouse .
c02-030-00 When the final miracle does occur , it is accepted as a
c02-030-01 marvellous joke ; no one has learned anything . Wicki
c02-030-02 suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue . In
c02-030-03 complete silence he shows the faces of people
c02-030-04 walking in the streets , smug , content , satisfied ,
c02-030-05 and thoroughly frightening . Wicki has
c02-030-06 succeeded in his second film in
c02-030-07 recording his personal apocalypse of the
c02-030-08 last days of a sick society .
c02-035-00 It is most unfair to call " Malachias " a cut-rate
c02-035-01 " Dolce Vita , " for it is far more intimate and deeply
c02-035-02 felt . In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
c02-035-03 in " Titanic " by paralleling the last days of the
c02-035-04 Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner ,
c02-035-05 and paid for his audacity with his life .
c02-049-00 Strangely enough , the Berlin audience received
c02-049-01 the film with extreme coolness , much preferring
c02-049-02 Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing " Une Femme
c02-049-03 est une Femme , " a ninety-one minute hymn
c02-049-04 to " Vogue , " " Cahiers du Cinema , " and the
c02-049-05 worst aspects of the American cinema . From
c02-049-06 a brilliantly funny start , the work fizzles
c02-049-07 out into a series of repetitious sight-gags
c02-049-08 and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
c02-049-09 uninitiated ( including four plugs for Charles
c02-056-00 This director is at last being re-evaluated and
c02-056-01 given his proper place in the history of the
c02-056-02 German film . Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
c02-056-03 " Unheimliche Geschichten " ( 1920 ) , five ghost stories
c02-056-04 with a light touch , and there was much to admire
c02-056-05 in " Dreyfus " ( 1930 ) and the virtually unknown
c02-056-06 but extremely important " 1914 " ( 1931 ) , which
c02-056-07 tries to show that it took more than just
c02-056-08 Germany to start the First World War .

c02-059-02 generous in giving everyone something , and silver
c02-059-03 bears are awarded in every direction . Both the

c02-059-05 and the audience at the awards was particularly
c02-059-06 enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected
c02-059-07 as best actress for her work in the Godard
c02-059-08 film . Gifted with an interesting face , although little
c02-059-09 acting ability , she would seem to be well
c02-059-10 worth watching in the months to come .
c02-078-00 It has a great look of speed and technical fun
c02-078-01 about it , of enormous cinematic enjoyment , and
c02-078-02 above all of cinematic sense . Much of it has
c02-078-03 that air of improvisation , as of off-the-cuff
c02-078-04 living , that once seemed so new and so
c02-078-05 attractive . The story ( not that the story , in the
c02-078-06 sense of plot , matters much ; but in the sense of
c02-078-07 situation and movement it matters a lot ) is
c02-078-08 that of a man on the run ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) ,
c02-078-09 who spends a few days with an American girl
c02-082-00 Belmondo reappears at the Paris Pullman
c02-082-01 in Moderato Cantabile ( curiously trans-
c02-082-02 lated into Seven Days ... Seven Nights ...
c02-082-03 A certificate ) , Peter Brook's film made
c02-082-04 in France and shown last autumn at
c02-082-05 the London Film Festival . In spite of
c02-082-06 magnificent performances from him and
c02-082-07 from Jeanne Moreau , this has been fairly
c02-082-08 well trounced by the critics wherever it
c02-082-09 has appeared . Leisurely , even slow ,
c02-089-00 With a large blond youth of quite
c02-089-01 dazzling dumbness called Troy
c02-089-02 Donahue ; and Claudette Colbert , still
c02-089-03 charming amid the nonsense , and Karl
c02-089-04 Malden not knowing how to take it ,
c02-089-05 all rolling eyeballs like a villain
c03-000a-00 The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's
c03-000a-01 play A Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester
c03-000a-02 Square Theatre tomorrow . It has been produced
c03-000a-03 an directed by Mr. Tony Richardson , who is also
c03-000a-04 part-author with Miss Delaney of the script ,
c03-000a-05 and the great advantages to be derived from
c03-000a-06 this unity of conception and control are
c03-003a-00 This is not a filmed play . It has been
c03-003a-01 conceived throughout in terms of the cinema ,
c03-003a-02 and again and again it is the visual qualities
c03-003a-03 of the story , and the marriage of the central
c03-003a-04 characters to their background , which bring
c03-003a-05 the film so vividly to life . In Fanny , which
c03-003a-06 also has its premiere tomorrow , the director ,
c03-003a-07 Mr. Joshua Logan , attempted but failed to create
c03-003a-08 the atmosphere of a city .
c03-007a-00 In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
c03-007a-01 taken a town in the industrial North of England
c03-007a-02 and has made it live . The shabby streets and
c03-007a-03 wet pavements , the school play-grounds , the
c03-007a-04 public monuments and the rubbish strewn canals -
c03-007a-05 even the worn head-stones in the churchyard ,
c03-007a-06 " sacred to the memory of " - are seen as an
c03-007a-07 integral part of the story .
c03-016a-00 But there is heart in the telling , and an
c03-016a-01 intense realism in the situation . A young
c03-016a-02 girl lives in a single dingy room with
c03-016a-03 her slatternly , promiscuous mother . In such
c03-016a-04 surroundings she learns sex is something
c03-016a-05 sordid , and when she experiences it for the
c03-016a-06 first time herself it is incoherently , clumsily ,
c03-016a-07 but half inquisitively . As is the case in Fanny
c03-016a-08 her first lover is a sailor who leaves her
c03-016a-09 to bear his child and sails away .
c03-021a-00 In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by
c03-021a-01 an old man . Here it is a young homosexual ,
c03-021a-02 estranged from women but yet moved by a
c03-021a-03 strong maternal instinct to the unborn child
c03-021a-04 as much as to the expectant mother , who acts
c03-021a-05 as a protector and comforter to her in her
c03-021a-06 hour of need . He shares her room and gives
c03-021a-07 her his forlorn gift of companionship and sym-
c03-021a-08 pathy - " you need someone to love you while
c03-021a-09 you are looking for someone to love " .
c03-081a-00 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a
c03-081a-01 technical error in allowing Irene to speak
c03-081a-02 for herself ; we would be altogether clearer
c03-081a-03 in our minds about her if she remained
c03-081a-04 a flawed but beautiful enigma , seen but not
c03-081a-05 heard . However , Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her
c03-081a-06 few brief scenes effective , and Mr. Dinsdale
c03-081a-07 Landen , in the longest and most exacting role ,
c03-081a-08 that of the sergeant , gives a performance of
c03-081a-09 rare intelligence and restrained power .
c03-084a-00 Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
c03-084a-01 effective , giving full value to the formal elements
c03-084a-02 of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing
c03-084a-03 them . Last night's play in the " Play of the
c03-084a-04 Week " series on independent television , Then
c03-084a-05 We Fall , by Mr. Paul Ferris , was a morality
c03-084a-06 on the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
c03-084a-07 power of unbridled ambition .
c03-087a-00 It went , perhaps , some distance beyond most
c03-087a-01 treatments of its subject by attempting to
c03-087a-02 generate a melodramatic inevitability which
c03-087a-03 left its central character and the world
c03-087a-04 around him in complete , unredeemable desolation .
c03-087a-05 We could , perhaps , say whether or not the attempt
c03-087a-06 succeeded if we had a little more faith in the
c03-087a-07 way in which Mr. Ferris manipulated his
c03-094a-00 Mr. William Lucas ( Morris ) is always insensi-
c03-094a-01 tively pushing , Miss Sheila Allen his wife ,
c03-094a-02 always palely appealing , Mr. James Maxwell ,
c03-094a-03 the editor , always comically abashed by the
c03-094a-04 events , and Mr. Aubrey Richards , the father-in-
c03-094a-05 law , always comically grotesque ; they were
c03-094a-06 not asked to modulate from their set moods
c03-094a-07 but played with proper efficiency and , in
c03-094a-08 the case of Mr. Richards , with lavish and
c03-096a-00 Only Mr. Lucas's actions , therefore , arose
c03-096a-01 explicably from appreciable motives . The rest ,
c03-096a-02 one feels , were driven to effective action by
c03-096a-03 the author in spite of the ineffectuality
c03-096a-04 with which he had endowed them . One
c03-096a-05 hopes that he is not asking us to believe
c03-096a-06 that , because of their odd accents , they
c03-096a-07 act oddly like the queer foreigners of

c03-000e-00 The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's
c03-000e-01 play A Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester
c03-000e-03 and directed by Mr. Tony Richardson , who is
c03-000e-04 also part-author with Miss Delaney of the
c03-000e-05 script , and the great advantages to be
c03-000e-06 derived from this unity of conception and
c03-000e-07 control are everywhere apparent .
c03-003e-00 This is not a filmed play . It has been con-
c03-003e-01 ceived throughout in terms of the cinema ,
c03-003e-02 and again and again it is the visual qualities
c03-003e-03 of the story , and the marriage of the central
c03-003e-04 characters to their background , which bring
c03-003e-05 the film so vividly to life . In Fanny , which
c03-003e-06 also has its premiere tomorrow , the director ,
c03-003e-07 Mr. Joshua Logan , attempted but failed to
c03-003e-08 create the atmosphere of a city .
c03-007e-00 In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
c03-007e-01 taken a town in the industrial North of
c03-007e-02 England and has made it live . The shabby
c03-007e-03 streets and wet pavements , the school play-
c03-007e-04 grounds , the public monuments and the
c03-007e-05 rubbish strewn canals - even the worn
c03-007e-06 head-stones in the churchyard , " sacred to
c03-007e-07 the memory of " - are seen as an integral
c03-016e-00 But there is heart in the telling , and an
c03-016e-01 intense realism in the situation . A young
c03-016e-02 girl lives in a single dingy room with her
c03-016e-03 slatternly , promiscuous mother . In such
c03-016e-04 surroundings she learns sex is something
c03-016e-05 sordid , and when she experiences it for the
c03-016e-06 first time herself it is incoherently ,
c03-016e-07 clumsily , but half shyly and half in-
c03-016e-08 quisitively . As is the case in Fanny her
c03-016e-09 first lover is a sailor who leaves her to
c03-016e-10 bear his child and sails away .
c03-021e-00 In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended
c03-021e-01 by an old man . Here it is a young homo-
c03-021e-02 sexual , estranged from women but yet moved
c03-021e-03 by a strong maternal instinct to the unborn
c03-021e-04 child as much as to the expectant mother ,
c03-021e-05 who acts as a protector and comforter to
c03-021e-06 her in her hour of need . He shares her room
c03-021e-07 and gives her his forlorn gift of com-
c03-021e-08 panionship and sympathy - " you need someone
c03-021e-09 to love you while you are looking for
c03-081e-00 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a
c03-081e-01 technical error in allowing Irene to speak
c03-081e-02 for herself ; we would be altogether clearer
c03-081e-03 in our minds about her if she remained
c03-081e-04 a flawed but beautiful enigma , seen but
c03-081e-05 not heard . However , Miss Pinkie Johnstone
c03-081e-06 makes her few brief scenes effective , and
c03-081e-07 Mr. Dinsdale Landen , in the longest and most
c03-081e-08 exacting role , that of the sergeant , gives a perfor-
c03-081e-09 mance of rare intelligence and restrained
c03-084e-00 Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
c03-084e-01 effective , giving full value to the formal elements
c03-084e-02 of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing
c03-084e-03 them . Last night's play in the " Play of the
c03-084e-04 Week " series on independent television , Then We
c03-084e-05 Fall , by Mr. Paul Ferris , was a morality on
c03-084e-06 the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
c03-084e-07 power of unbridled ambition .
c03-087e-00 It went , perhaps , some distance beyond most
c03-087e-01 treatments of its subject by attempting to
c03-087e-02 generate a melodramatic inevitability
c03-087e-03 which left its central character and the world
c03-087e-04 around him in complete , unredeemable de-
c03-087e-05 solation . We could , perhaps , say whether or not
c03-087e-06 the attempt succeeded if we had a little more
c03-087e-07 faith in the way in which Mr. Ferris mani-
c03-087e-08 pulated his characters .
c03-094e-00 Mr. William Lucas ( Morris ) is always insen-
c03-094e-01 sitively pushing , Miss Sheila Allen his wife ,
c03-094e-02 always palely appealing , Mr. James Maxwell ,
c03-094e-03 the editor , always comically abashed by
c03-094e-04 the events , and Mr. Aubrey Richards , the
c03-094e-05 father-in-law , always comically grotesque ;
c03-094e-06 they were not asked to modulate from
c03-094e-07 their set moods but played with proper
c03-094e-08 efficiency and , in the case of Mr. Richards ,
c03-094e-09 with lavish and suitably gaudy colour .
c03-096e-00 Only Mr. Lucas's actions , therefore , arose
c03-096e-01 explicably from appreciable motives . The
c03-096e-02 rest , one feels , were driven to effective action by
c03-096e-03 the author in spite of the ineffectuality with
c03-096e-04 which he had endowed them . One hopes that he
c03-096e-05 is not asking us to believe that , because of
c03-096e-06 their odd accents , they act oddly like the
c03-096e-07 queer foreigners of tradition .

c04-000-00 NEXT month that friendly , effervescent performer Frankie
c04-000-01 Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage
c04-000-02 in a new show . To paraphrase his well-known ditty :
c04-000-03 " He 'll have the limelight , they 'll give him the girls -
c04-004-00 I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
c04-004-01 old , star-studded West End than he will ever feel in
c04-004-02 Hollywood . His American bosses , 20th-Century Fox , have
c04-004-03 recently given Frankie the full , razzamataz , red-carpet
c04-004-04 treatment . But they haven't done a thing for his film
c04-004-05 career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
c04-004-06 doing better here , before the platinum-plated Hollywood
c04-004-07 carrot was dangled before his nose .
c04-008-00 In his first Hollywood picture , " Let 's Make Love , " he
c04-008-01 was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe
c04-008-02 and Yves Montand . Against this couple Frankie , in
c04-008-03 a cardboard role , didn't stand a chance . Now comes
c04-008-04 " The Right Approach " ( Rialto , " A " ) , and it 's a glum
c04-008-05 business . He plays an aspiring actor - a
c04-008-06 selfish , arrogant , brash , ambitious , unscrupulous heel -
c04-008-07 who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in
c04-013-00 He double-crosses the five pals with whom he lives ,
c04-013-01 cheats a waitress ( Juliet Prowse ) and cynically uses
c04-013-02 a magazine editress ( Martha Hyer ) to get ahead .
c04-013-03 Frankie Vaughan is too nice a chap to ring quite
c04-013-04 true as a smooth-tongued , ill-mannered Yank . His
c04-013-05 best moments are when he swings breezily into the
e04-000-00 HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
e04-000-01 family man or father-to-be . Unlike many
e04-000-02 commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and
e04-000-03 capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
e04-000-04 most destructive youngster . Almost any available
e04-000-05 timber can be used but Parana pine is
e04-000-06 recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and
c04-017-00 But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go
c04-017-01 for a new hit song . He might be well advised to
c04-017-02 think hard and long before his next jump into the
c04-017-04 VERDICT : Vaughan should have by-passed this approach .
c04-017-05 RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
c04-017-06 Hollywood treatment , thanks to a sound performance in
c04-017-07 " Taste of Fear " ( Warner Theatre , " X " ) .
c04-035-00 Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
c04-035-01 newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
c04-035-02 loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
c04-035-03 the river . The film starts off brightly enough but ,
c04-035-04 half-way through , the plot ( as well as the boat ) springs
c04-035-05 a near-disastrous leak . Familiar members of Britain's
c04-035-06 repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
c04-035-07 equally familiar hoops to mild laughter .
c04-023-00 He has earned his break . The film is a well-made
c04-023-01 variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast
c04-023-02 try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind .
c04-023-03 Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is
c04-023-04 built up neatly . Susan Strasberg is the crippled
c04-028-00 Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
c04-028-01 also effectively around . They provide some chilly red
c04-028-02 herrings in this " Find-the-body " thriller . VERDICT :
c04-028-03 Don't believe all you see and hear !
c04-028-04 NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney
c04-028-05 James has pumped life into a slim , strained
c04-028-06 comedy . He does his rescue act in " Double Bunk "
c04-028-07 ( Leicester-square Theatre , " A " ) .
c04-039-00 VERDICT : The " bunk " needed doubling .
c04-039-01 DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A T V's
c04-039-02 " Drama '61 " last night as a smooth ,
c04-039-03 scheming jewel thief in a play by Jacques
c04-039-04 Gillies , " The Takers . " A polished production
c04-039-05 by Quentin Lawrence , here , held together
c04-039-06 by Mr. Houston's accomplished
c04-039-07 performance as the master mind behind a
c04-044-00 This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000
c04-044-01 worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious . The play
c04-044-02 had style , moved at a quick pace and everyone did
c04-044-03 well . But it was Mr. Houston's evening .
c04-044-04 Earlier , on the Palladium show I found Stanley
c04-044-05 Holloway's act too long and not particularly
c04-044-06 entertaining . It was also a mistake to
c04-044-07 re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees
c04-044-08 so soon after their previous appearance .
c04-050-00 Their offering last night differed little
c04-050-01 from their earlier act on this show a week
c04-050-02 or so ago . But the Mudlarks , with Jeff Mudd
c04-050-03 out of the Army and back with sister Mary
c04-050-04 and brother Fred , were in bright , zestful
c04-050-05 form . Why only two numbers , though ? It
c04-050-06 was not enough . " A FAIR COP , " the B B C
c04-050-07 Whitehall farce last night , looked like
c04-050-08 a rabbit warren in a field of corn .
c04-056-00 I can't recall a production where so many
c04-056-01 comics bolted in and out of holes so often .
c04-056-02 The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
c04-056-03 lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
c04-056-04 of his trousers . The action moved at tremendous
c04-056-05 speed , backed by some wonderful timing by
c04-056-06 the cast . I especially liked the tea-cup
c04-056-07 scene where six of the cast changed
c04-056-08 cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers .
c04-061-00 Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
c04-061-01 as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable . They
c04-061-02 alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
c04-061-03 through the gormless standing corn around them . Perhaps
c04-061-04 it was accidental - I hope not . If ever a bag of
c04-061-05 humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
c04-061-06 farce is it when it comes to television .
c04-066-00 HOW do you get on records ? Well , you 've got
c04-066-01 to have something different . Sing slightly flat .
c04-066-02 All the good singers sing in tune . Twang a guitar
c04-066-03 slightly off key . Everybody 's fed up with the
c04-066-04 right way - so the best-seller charts say . Play
c04-066-05 an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one . You got to
c04-066-06 get it into your head , son ... people
c04-066-07 don't like things as they should be - not on

c04-075-01 disc solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out
c04-075-02 A PACKET OF DRAWING-PINS . " Why not , " thought ex-soldier

c04-075-04 " press a thumb-tack into the nose of the hammers that strike
c04-075-05 the piano strings ? " He did , on his piano at home . There weren't
c04-075-06 enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done .

c04-080-00 Then he tried it out for sound . Um-chink ...
c04-080-01 um-chink ... it went . Slightly flat and jangly in
c04-080-02 part . DELIGHTFUL ! He put the sound on tape . The
c04-080-03 tape went to the Philips company . Within two
c04-080-04 days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract . And they

e01-025-06 viable craft . It has , in fact , readily
e01-025-07 adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
e01-025-08 ustrations in the following pages will show
e01-025-09 how completely it is in sympathy with con-
e01-029-00 It will be seen how , with bold design
e01-029-01 and rich colour , knitting , crochet and
e01-029-02 tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
e01-029-03 can give striking individuality to many things
e01-029-04 in the home . Chairbacks , cushions , tablecloths ,
e01-029-05 to mention only three - how satisfying it is
e01-029-06 to avoid the ready-made in these and by
e01-029-07 one's own handiwork produce something
e01-029-08 that reflects true creative talent .
e01-032-00 The more delicate patterns and finer
e01-032-01 threads may be reserved to bring a light
e01-032-02 and lovely touch to personal possessions -
e01-032-03 a lace border to a handkerchief , fine-lace
e01-032-04 insertion on a petticoat or blouse , a tatted edge
e01-032-05 to a collar ; these add a charming , feminine
e01-032-06 distinction that nothing else can give .
e01-032-07 Although we assess lace-making as one of
e01-032-08 the feminine skills , a number of the well-loved
e01-032-09 traditional patterns that we follow today were ,
e01-032-10 in fact , the brain-children of inventive men .
e01-035-00 For in the old order of things , men designed
e01-035-01 and worked lace as well as women and
e01-035-02 special schools were set up to teach lace-
e01-035-03 making not only to young girls , but to little
e01-035-04 boys as well . Whole families made their
e01-035-05 livelihood by lace-making and consequently
e01-035-06 a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew
e01-035-07 up around the lace industry .
e01-050-00 During the sixteenth century a considerable
e01-050-01 amount of crochet was produced in the
e01-050-02 convents of Europe . Without doubt it was the
e01-050-03 nuns who carried the craft to Ireland . There it
e01-050-04 was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
e01-050-05 form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings . During
e01-050-06 the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
e01-059-00 In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
e01-059-01 hand-crocheted blouses , gossamer fine in
e01-059-02 texture , are sold at a very high price . With a
e01-059-03 little time and concentration the woman at home can
e01-059-04 produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
e01-059-05 Paris - a blouse , delicate gloves or a fine
e01-059-06 edging for collar , cuffs or a handkerchief .
e01-062-00 In the home , crochet lace can be used to make
e01-062-01 tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings
e01-062-02 from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
e01-062-03 functions . The art of crochet is not difficult and
e01-062-04 it is reasonably quick to work . In the following
e01-062-05 pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
e01-062-06 to enable the beginner to master all the essential
e01-081-00 First launder crochet and then pin to the required
e01-081-01 shape , ensuring that all lines of the crochet are
e01-081-02 accurate . Place crochet in correct position on linen and
e01-081-03 secure with pins . Run a line of basting stitches
e01-081-04 on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
e01-081-05 which are to be attached to the linen . Remove crochet .
e01-086-00 Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen :
e01-086-01 ( a ) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches ,
e01-086-02 the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
e01-086-03 outside edge . Oversew crochet to button stitch .
e01-086-04 ( b ) Turn under a small hem , with fold lying on line
e01-086-05 of basting stitches . Work a row of dc all round
e01-086-06 this hem , with 3 dc at each corner .
e01-092-00 Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word ,
e01-092-01 Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
e01-092-02 are of the utmost importance to the worker .
e01-092-03 It washes beautifully , never loses its colour
e01-092-04 nor becomes ' stringy ' , is very elastic and
e01-092-05 preserves the beauty of the design . It is easy
e01-092-06 to work with , soft , glossy and of uniform
e01-092-07 thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread .
e01-102-00 Remember that texture plays an important part in
e01-102-01 the beauty of crochet . The finer mercerised threads
e01-102-02 are more effective for the delicate designs used for
e01-102-03 tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while
e01-102-04 the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,
e01-102-05 chairbacks , luncheon mats , etc. Crochet hooks
e01-102-06 are made of steel , composition or bone . Steel
e01-102-07 crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0 ,
e01-102-08 the largest , to number 8 , the smallest .
e01-107-00 Each size of hook is made for use with a certain
e01-107-01 size of thread . To ensure the correct results ,
e01-107-02 it is important that you use the size of hook
e01-107-03 specified in the directions . These are the
e01-107-04 correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet :
e01-107-05 Directions are given for a small practice
e01-107-06 piece for each stitch that you learn . When
e01-107-07 you have become proficient in these
e01-107-08 stitches , attractive articles can be made
e01-107-09 from the directions included in this book .
e01-113-00 1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb
e01-113-01 and forefinger . 2 . Make a loop by
e01-113-02 lapping long thread over short thread .
e01-113-03 3 . Hold loop in place between thumb
e01-113-04 and forefinger ( Fig. 1 ) . 1 . Take hold
e01-113-05 of broad bar of hook as you would a
e01-113-06 pencil . Bring middle finger forward to
e01-119-00 2 . Insert hook through loop and under long
e01-119-01 thread . Catch long end of thread ( Fig. 2 ) .
e01-119-02 Draw loop through . 3 . Do not remove hook
e01-119-03 from thread . Pull short end and ball thread
e01-119-04 in opposite directions to bring loop close around
e01-119-05 the end of the hook , but not too tight
e01-119-06 ( Fig. 3 ) . Loop thread round little finger ,
e01-119-07 across palm and behind forefinger ( Fig. 4 ) .
f01-139-00 This is what I mean by " getting things the wrong way
f01-139-01 round " . He is far more likely to find out about how
f01-139-02 his own mind works by looking at other people's .
f01-139-03 For although looking inwards ( or " introspecting "
f01-139-04 as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out ,
f01-139-05 nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
f01-139-06 one of the most unreliable methods of getting
g01-000-00 A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
g01-000-01 imprisoned in England . His son , in revenge , was
g01-000-02 harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg ,
g01-000-03 and doing it to some purpose . John Philpot ,
g01-000-04 one of that new class of merchant financiers
g01-000-05 which the city of London was now producing , fitted ,
g01-000-06 equipped and manned a fleet from his own
g01-000-07 resources , and captured the young Mercer in a
e02-000-00 A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
e02-000-01 legs , and in reproduction period pieces they
e02-000-02 are frequently used . The simpler varieties are
e02-000-03 extremely easy to work , the four sides being
e02-000-04 simply planed to give the required taper . In
e02-000-05 the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is
e02-000-06 worked in the solid , and this certainly
e02-000-07 complicates the operation .
e02-014-00 For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
e02-014-01 The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
e02-014-02 on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated
e02-014-03 as before . It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
e02-014-04 the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
e02-014-05 of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
e02-018-00 A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
e02-018-01 end reveals when the required amount
e02-018-02 has been removed , and if care is taken
e02-018-03 to stop the plane short of the squared
e02-018-04 pencil line at the top , the work will be
e02-018-05 accurate . The straight-edge can be used
e02-018-06 to test the straightness of the sides .
e02-021-00 Incidentally , it is better to
e02-021-01 complete any mortising that may be
e02-021-02 needed at the top before the tapering is
e02-021-03 begun . Some plain tapered legs have
e02-021-04 the taper on the two inner faces only ,
e02-021-05 the outer surfaces being vertical as
e02-021-06 at ( B ) , Fig. 1 . To make a leg such as
e02-021-07 that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first
e02-021-08 marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 .
e02-025-00 Note that squared lines marking
e02-025-01 the top member of the toe are
e02-025-02 needed as well as the upper ex-
e02-025-03 tent of the taper , and in
e02-025-04 this case it is necessary to
e02-025-05 mark in the line of the taper
e02-025-06 with pencil and straight-edge
e02-025-07 as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 . A saw cut is
e02-025-08 made at the upper toe line
e02-025-09 exactly down to the taper line ,
e02-074-00 But why woodwork in particular ? Well , there
e02-074-01 are many reasons . Wood is in good and
e02-074-02 common supply ; it lends itself to making
e02-074-03 innumerable useful household items -
e02-074-04 furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;
e02-074-05 it enables results to be obtained fairly
e02-074-06 quickly ; it is less expensive than most
e02-074-07 other materials ; it is a pleasant material
e02-074-08 to work with ; and , although it does
e02-074-09 create a certain amount of mess , it is
e02-074-10 all clean and easily cleared away .
e02-082-00 This last point is certainly important because almost
e02-082-01 everyone has come to recognise that machines
e02-082-02 are not only an economic necessity , but that a
e02-082-03 great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
e02-082-04 installation of a power tool . As an elementary
e02-082-05 example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy
e02-082-06 ripping out parts from hardwood . Most men
e02-082-07 would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
e02-086-00 Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin
e02-086-01 with what we have called a bare minimum kit . Probably
e02-086-02 most men have some of the tools already . It will enable
e02-086-03 a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in
e02-086-04 any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
e02-086-05 which other tools can be added as the need arises . The
e02-086-06 nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
e02-086-07 to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
e02-086-08 which increases the range of things that can be
e02-091-00 As a still further development , we follow
e02-091-01 with a good basic kit , which includes
e02-091-02 the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course ,
e02-091-03 includes the bare minimum kit ) .
e02-091-04 With this the vast majority of jobs
e02-091-05 can be done , though for advanced
e02-091-06 cabinet work the necessity for
e02-091-07 certain special tools will become
e02-094-00 Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and
e02-094-01 machines , the choice of which will
e02-094-02 depend partly upon the space available
e02-094-03 in the workshop , the amount one
e02-094-04 is prepared to pay , and the type of
e02-094-05 work a man normally does . First ,
e02-094-06 however , a word of advice generally .
e02-094-07 Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
e02-094-08 machines . They never are cheap in the
e02-094-09 long run . They may be inaccurate ,
e02-100-00 Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults
e02-100-01 in design or quality soon become apparent . It is far
e02-100-02 better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
e02-100-03 quality , and not handicap yourself from the start .
e02-100-04 To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow
e02-100-05 yourself to blame the tools when the job does
e02-117-00 Many men with only limited accommodation
e02-117-01 have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table .
e02-117-02 Providing this is sound , some perfectly good
e02-117-03 work can be done on it , but the usual problems
e02-117-04 are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage
e02-117-05 place for tools . The combined bench top and
e02-117-06 tool cupboard shown here has been specially
e02-117-07 designed and made for WOODWORKER
e02-117-08 readers who have this difficulty .
e04-004-00 Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
e04-004-01 timber as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the timber will have already
e04-004-02 been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with
e04-004-03 a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters
e04-004-04 will show up after painting . The dimensions given enable the
e04-004-05 feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height
e04-008-00 All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned ,
e04-008-01 which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
e04-008-02 appearance . The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
e04-008-03 each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C ) ,
e04-011-00 See Fig. 2 . These are then glued and
e04-011-01 pinned into place . A similar piece of 1 in.
e04-011-02 by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
e04-011-03 the end of the feeding tray as seen in
e04-011-04 Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
e04-011-05 hardboard is covered with plastic material
e04-011-06 for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
e04-011-07 the frame with panel pins to complete
e04-015-00 Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
e04-015-01 fits up against the front legs of the
e04-015-02 chair . The seat rests across the upper two
e04-015-03 cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
e04-015-04 glued and panel pinned in position , measurements
e04-015-05 being taken directly from the work . Fig. 4
e04-015-06 shows the framework for the back which
e04-015-07 is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber .
e04-019-00 The amount of the backward tilt and
e04-019-01 also the height is left to personal choice
e04-019-02 and the width is best taken directly
e04-019-03 from the work to ensure a good fit .
e04-019-04 Fix the piece A to the sides first
e04-019-05 with glue and panel pins and then fit
e04-019-06 the frame together with the piece
e04-019-07 B temporarily in place on the chair
e04-022-00 Decide on the required angle of slope ,
e04-022-01 keeping B flat on the chair seat , and mark
e04-022-02 off the exact position of B on the side
e04-022-03 pieces . These can then be cut at the correct
e04-022-04 angle and B is glued and nailed in place .
e04-022-05 A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
e04-022-06 to the frame and its edges planed off
e04-026-00 Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
e04-026-01 screws driven from the inside . The footrest is a
e04-026-02 piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
e04-026-03 by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
e04-026-04 of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5 . When determining
e04-026-05 the position of the footrest , do not place too near
e04-026-06 the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs .
e04-030-00 To complete the job , screw two fittings to the
e04-030-01 inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
e04-030-02 back to hold the baby's safety harness . These can be
e04-030-03 made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
e04-030-04 wire as shown in Fig. 6 . Make sure that these
e04-030-05 are well secured as they will have to withstand
e04-030-06 considerable pulling as the child becomes older .
e04-034-00 Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
e04-034-01 with plastic wood . Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
e04-034-02 framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the
e04-034-03 edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) . Fill the grain with a
e04-034-04 woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
e04-034-05 a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour
e04-034-06 for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
e04-034-07 a suitable nursery transfer .
e04-038-00 Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
e04-038-01 if junior decides to bite the chair . Finally , it is as well
e04-038-02 to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
e04-038-03 material that might be available as otherwise the
e04-038-04 paint would soon be scratched off .
e04-038-05 ( J.H.P. ) BUILDING your own boat is a most
e04-038-06 satisfying and worthwhile project .
e04-043-00 Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
e04-043-01 rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
e04-043-02 sold . It is especially designed for simplicity in
e04-043-03 construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,
e04-043-04 and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
e04-043-05 weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
e04-043-06 and an outboard motor with a comfortable
e04-052-00 For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails
e04-052-01 in place of screws . We just bend them over and clamp
e04-052-02 firmly by using a hammer on each side . Over here I 've
e04-052-03 always used brass screws , which are more expensive . The first
e04-052-04 job is to make your moulds . In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply ,
e04-052-05 but to save money any scrap may be used , and if this
e04-052-06 is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked
e04-058-00 If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
e04-058-01 the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in
e04-058-02 Fig. 2 . The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
e04-058-03 rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building
e04-058-04 and shaping your little craft , upside-down . For cheapness
e04-058-05 I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
e04-062-00 This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
e04-062-01 a permanently water proof glue line . Be sure to
e04-062-02 see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior .
e04-062-03 This may be bought at any good timber merchants .
e04-062-04 The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
e04-062-05 wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany . For the
e04-062-06 last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old
e04-062-07 mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
e04-068-00 I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
e04-068-01 rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) . They are very simple , cheap
e04-068-02 and easy to make . As will be seen from the plan
e04-068-03 there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
e04-068-04 I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
e04-068-05 is difficult to obtain here and expensive . I overcome
e04-068-06 this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 .
e04-079-00 Cut the moulds and the
e04-079-01 transoms to shape as in the
e04-079-02 detailed drawings . If you have
e04-079-03 a wooden floor you can use
e04-079-04 ' A ' frames fastened to the floor
e04-079-05 if not , use a strong horizontal
e04-079-06 frame that will sit firmly on
e04-079-07 the ground or concrete floor . I
e04-079-08 use a heavy old base as in
e04-083-00 The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
e04-083-01 correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat .
e04-083-02 Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
e04-083-03 to allow for the chines to rest in these
e04-083-04 notches , as they are not fastened to the
e04-083-05 moulds , which will only be used whilst
e04-083-06 the hull is under construction .
g04-003-00 Dr. Davidson said he would go for
g04-003-01 a walk over the fields while we attended
g04-003-02 to our business . To my amusement ,
g04-003-03 when we met at tea at the rectory
g04-003-04 after the Dedication , the Archbishop
g04-003-05 said he had been stopped by
g04-003-06 a farmer in a field . He seemed
g04-003-07 rather indignant , but we took the
g04-003-08 episode without a smile till afterwards .
h04-000-00 Nevertheless , average net family income
h04-000-01 was appreciably higher in families with
h04-000-02 several children than in those with only ,
h04-000-03 many of which were incomplete families
h04-000-04 of younger parents with lower earnings ,
h04-000-05 and of course with lower tax reliefs and
h04-000-06 no family allowances . The rise in net family
h04-000-07 incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
h04-000-08 est for childless couples , especially older
h04-000-09 couples ( probably because of the
k04-017-00 ' Are you enjoying yourself , Olimpia ? ' she
k04-017-01 asked idly , tapping the girl's cheek lightly with
k04-017-02 her fan , in passing ; but she did not wait for
k04-017-03 the answer . Disturbed by vague uneasiness , she
k04-017-04 was wondering whether Olimpia had been
k04-017-05 watching her talk with Orsini . Surely she
k04-017-06 could not have overheard anything they
k04-017-07 said ? A moment's reflection reassured her
k04-017-08 on that point , for she was certain no one
k04-017-09 had been standing near them .
e04-086-00 The chine is the long stringer on each side which
e04-086-01 is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
e04-086-02 cut in the moulds . Each chine is made of oak ,
e04-086-03 ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood . I
e04-086-04 prefer spruce when available . As will be seen
e04-086-05 in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.
k04-022-00 However , something inimical in the girl's look
k04-022-01 put Vittoria on guard . ' Santa Maria ! These spying
k04-022-02 eyes ! ' she thought , bitterly . Doria was continually
k04-022-03 stopping on the way , to point out , with childish pride ,
k04-022-04 objects of beauty or interest . Vittoria , on the
k04-022-05 fringe of the party , caught snatches of this
k04-022-06 information , which held no interest for her :
k04-022-07 ' ... now this sapphire ...
e04-091-00 The chines are morticed into this and butt up
e04-091-01 against the transom . Start at the bow and
e04-091-02 spring them both at the same time over the
e04-091-03 slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
e04-091-04 cut for this purpose in the stern or after
e04-091-05 transom framing . Glue , screw and make fast .
e04-095-00 The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,
e04-095-01 and this is the time to check before making fast
e04-095-02 to see that nothing is distorted . Ensure that
e04-095-03 the outside measurements from transom to transom
e04-095-04 are equal on each side and that the transoms
e04-095-05 are parallel horizontally . Next bevel the chines
e04-095-06 with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
e04-099-00 Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
e04-099-01 plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
e04-099-02 planing after fixing to the boat . Use your two
e04-099-03 lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
e04-099-04 purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from
e04-099-05 the other . If care is taken not to waste the
e04-099-06 ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts .
e04-132-00 While these may ultimately be made into a picture
e04-132-01 for framing and hanging on a wall , they may
e04-132-02 also be arranged into a design , and the
e04-132-03 resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
e04-103-00 Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready
e04-103-01 to plank the sides . Start again at the bows ,
e04-103-02 clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp . Bend
e04-103-03 round the frame to the stern and clamp there . If
e04-103-04 you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
e04-103-05 well . After generously covering with glue , screw
e04-103-06 the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
e04-109-00 Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
e04-109-01 with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if
e04-109-02 you are doing it that way . Use flat head screws
e04-109-03 about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
e04-109-04 the 1/4 in. ply . Make a very small hole for
e04-109-05 the screw to allow for a good grip . Remember
e04-114-00 Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,
e04-114-01 which is cut in one piece . It should overlap just a
e04-114-02 trifle ; this can be cleaned up later . As you are
e04-114-03 screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
e04-114-04 necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
e04-114-05 the screws . I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
e04-114-06 the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and
e04-114-07 the bottom shaped transom facing .
e04-119-00 Again , don't forget to glue . Now put on the keel and
e04-119-01 the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
e04-119-02 the moulds . You won't want them again for this boat , so
e04-119-03 shift them right out of the way . Place the boat right side
e04-119-04 up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
e04-124-00 Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts ( seats )
e04-124-01 taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
e04-124-02 with vertical members as shown in the plans . Make the
e04-124-03 four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
e04-124-04 before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
e04-124-05 a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale )
e04-127-00 I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
e04-127-01 with copper nails and roves . It greatly improves the
e04-127-02 appearance and the strength . Paint with good marine primer ,
e04-127-03 undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint .
e04-127-04 WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
e04-127-05 into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
e04-127-06 making fabric pictures or designs .
e07-003-00 Wholesale chemical spraying , upsetting as it
e07-003-01 does the balance of nature by killing both pests
e07-003-02 and predators , is viewed with concern by a
e07-003-03 number of American State Research Stations . Not
e07-003-04 content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
e07-003-05 of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture ,
e07-003-06 some stations are carrying out useful research on
e07-003-07 pest control by biological means . Both native and
e07-003-08 imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
e07-003-09 are used in field trial tests .
e07-007-00 The biological control of pests in the garden
e07-007-01 is not new to the American gardener . Lady-
e07-007-02 birds figure in press advertisements , their
e07-007-03 sale being by the gallon . Praying mantis ( Mantis
e07-007-04 religiosa ) , both native and " immigrant " varieties ,
e07-007-05 are used by gardeners in all parts of the United
e07-007-06 States . Advertisements offer eggs of European ,
e07-007-07 Chinese or native forms of mantis .
e07-012-00 From the day it hatches in the spring
e07-012-01 until it dies in the late autumn , the
e07-012-02 praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
e07-012-03 eating other insects . Nine blowflies
e07-012-04 may be consumed at one sitting and
e07-012-05 the fully adult , 2 1/2-in.-long insect ,
e07-012-06 is able to keep a firm hold on one
e07-012-07 grasshopper while eating another .
e07-012-08 According to Dr. Max Beier in " Fang-
e07-012-09 heuschrecken " ( Die Neue Brehm Bu"ckerei ,
e07-012-10 1952 ) , the praying mantis is trecking
e07-061-00 Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
e07-061-01 egg-case of the Chinese mantis . The
e07-061-02 first mantis had hatched from the very large
e07-061-03 egg-case on June 6 . Both the Chinese
e07-061-04 and Spanish mantis , in the young stage
e07-061-05 at any rate , are light brown in colour .
e07-061-06 Because of the cool , wet weather , I had great
e07-061-07 difficulty in breeding fruit flies and , after
e07-061-08 many of the mantis of both types had died
e07-061-09 in my Kilner jars , I poured living mantis
e07-061-10 over vines and peachtrees .
e07-066-00 A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
e07-066-01 Grantham , Lincs , kindly offered to
e07-066-02 cooperate with me in studying praying
e07-066-03 mantis as a pest control in the cold
e07-066-04 greenhouse . Of the dozen Spanish mantis
e07-066-05 sent him by post on June 22 , only two or
e07-066-06 three survived the journey ; one thrived
e07-066-07 and the latest report I have is that
e07-066-08 this mantis is still alive .
e07-072-00 DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
e07-072-01 since the end of the war , clay pots are
e07-072-02 still in greatest demand . It is mostly
e07-072-03 in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
e07-072-04 have made headway , and although
e07-072-05 numerous small clay pots are used each
e07-072-06 year , they are fewer than they were 10
e07-072-07 years ago . In the larger sizes there is still
e07-072-08 no real substitute for clay that can be
e07-072-09 obtained at a comparable price , except the
e07-072-10 bituminized paper pots which are used on
e07-072-11 commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
e07-076-00 The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
e07-076-01 brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
e07-076-02 handling , the annual losses are often around
e07-076-03 10 per cent. , and where the handling and
e07-076-04 storage facilities are not too good , these
e07-076-05 losses will be even greater . This does not
e07-076-06 necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as
e07-076-07 they are not quite so fragile as the
e07-076-08 smaller ones and are not normally thrown
e07-076-09 about in quite the same way .
e07-079-00 The storage problem puts clay pots at a
e07-079-01 definite disadvantage . They are fairly heavy
e07-079-02 and difficult things to accommodate and
e07-079-03 they must have some protection from severe
e07-079-04 weather , which can be quite a headache in
e07-079-05 a small garden . While admitting that
e07-079-06 broken pots have on occasions provided
e07-079-07 artists with delightful studies , there is no
e07-079-08 doubt that a pile of badly stacked ,
e07-079-09 half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
e07-083-00 Every garden boy will agree that having to
e07-083-01 wash clay pots is a definite factor in
e07-083-02 favour of their abolition ; in fact one
e07-083-03 young man was so wholehearted about this
e07-083-04 a few years ago that he made the headlines
e07-083-05 for having smashed a large number # to
e07-083-06 relieve his feelings . On the small-to-medium
e07-083-07 establishment , it is a disagreeable chore
e07-083-08 which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,
e07-083-09 whereas on larger establishments the pots
e07-083-10 can be sterilized or washed by machine .
e07-086-00 It is not easy to make an economic
e07-086-01 comparison between clay pots and the various
e07-086-02 substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely
e07-086-03 with luck , while the latter are often
e07-086-04 expendable used only once . Clay pots are
e07-086-05 efficient and congenial containers in which
e07-086-06 to grow plants . In their proper setting they
e07-086-07 are not unattractive and , in spite of
e07-086-08 their shortcomings , most gardeners have
e07-086-09 a nostalgic affection for them .
e07-090-00 Present-day pots are better finished , do
e07-090-01 not get dirty so readily and are easier to
e07-090-02 wash . The deep rims make for neater and
e07-090-03 safer stacking , though they are still
e07-090-04 expensive and still get broken . On the
e07-090-05 other hand , there is really no replacement
e07-090-06 for the larger sizes , so they have the
e07-090-07 decided advantage of being the only
e07-090-08 suitable container available in quantity
e07-094-00 Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
e07-094-01 pots for plant raising . These are compressed blocks of
e07-094-02 compost , made in a specially devised press to
e07-094-03 simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
e07-094-04 Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they
e07-094-05 are made of the same compost as would have
e07-094-06 been used in a pot , the # only difference being
e07-094-07 that it is used in a slightly moister
e07-098-00 Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them
e07-098-01 in the normal way , the only real difference
e07-098-02 being that more of the watering is done through a
e07-098-03 rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
e07-098-04 of water . First-class plants of tomatoes ,
e07-098-05 cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers ,
e07-098-06 celery and onions , may all be raised in soil
e07-098-07 blocks ; so can such flowering plants as
e07-098-08 dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas ,
e07-098-09 lupins and numerous others .
e07-101-00 One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
e07-101-01 one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
e07-101-02 completely . Manufacturing the block and planting
e07-101-03 it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,
e07-101-04 and a superior plant , which transplants more
e07-101-05 easily , is produced . The obvious limitation #
e07-101-06 is that soil blocks can only be used for
e07-101-07 propagating ; there can be no progression to a
e07-101-08 larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
e07-101-09 to be moved ; it must be planted out or
e07-105-00 Many amateur gardeners might improve their
e07-105-01 results by buying a small hand-operated soil
e07-105-02 block maker and use the money saved on
e07-105-03 buying small pots to improve their composts .
e07-105-04 The various types of small paper pots are very
e07-105-05 useful for short-term operations , but are
e07-105-06 inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
e07-108-00 They are # quite useful for plants that are
e07-108-01 despatched to market or direct to customers ,
e07-108-02 their cheapness making them attractive to the
e07-108-03 nurseryman ; there is also considerable saving
e07-108-04 in carriage costs because of their lightness .
e07-108-05 There are many types of plastic pots available ;
e07-108-06 some expensive , some quite cheap ; some good
e07-108-07 and others not so good . A wide range of
e07-108-08 plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
e07-108-09 usually need less water than those in clay
e07-112-00 They are slightly more difficult to
e07-112-01 manage , however , until a little experience
e07-112-02 has been gained with them . Plastic pots
e07-112-03 are usually more expensive than clay ones ,
e07-112-04 but they are almost indestructible and
e07-112-05 will last a long time with normal care .
f01-053-00 The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
f01-053-01 vocabulary to work on the existing store
f01-053-02 so as to make it grow . He does not
f01-053-03 simply pack new things into the store .
f01-053-04 The solitary learner has to find out
f01-053-05 how to do this for himself , with the help
f01-053-06 of books . He uses his vocabulary to
f01-053-07 ask questions and uses the books to
f01-058-00 Thus learning how to learn means becoming
f01-058-01 your own philosopher , your own psychologist
f01-058-02 and your own teacher . You will then be
f01-058-03 a well-established learner and the world
f01-058-04 will be at your feet . Although the word
f01-058-05 " mind " has given rise to endless
f01-058-06 controversy among philosophers and psycho-
f01-058-07 logists , many of whom would like to
f01-058-08 abolish it from the dictionary , most
f01-058-09 of us obstinately go on using it .
f01-066-00 And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
f01-066-01 " mind " vanishes , at any rate for some time . It seems very difficult
f01-066-02 to detach the mind from the brain , and all the biological ,
f01-066-03 surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
f01-066-04 close connection . There is a lot to be said for keeping the
f01-066-05 word " soul " to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
f01-066-06 essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
f01-066-07 the body , and to reserve the more prosaic word " mind " for
f01-066-08 the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
f01-066-09 are clearly associated with the brain .
f01-070-00 Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
f01-070-01 picture of this " basis " of mental phenomena ?
f01-070-02 The physicists have succeeded remarkably well ,
f01-070-03 with the atomic theory , in giving a clear and detailed
f01-070-04 picture of the basis of such material phenomena
f01-070-05 as chemical action , magnetism , the behaviour of
f01-070-06 gases and so on . Where has psychology got to in its
f01-070-07 theories of " mind " ? Are there any ultimate units
f01-070-08 of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?
f01-075-00 At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
f01-075-01 be analysed into discrete bits . These bits were
f01-075-02 identified as elementary sensations . These were
f01-075-03 thought to combine together to form compound
f01-075-04 experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
f01-075-05 matter combine to form molecular compounds .
f01-075-06 But this view led to too many difficulties and
f01-075-07 was finally abandoned . Nevertheless the search
f01-075-08 for basic units of mind has gone on and will
f01-075-09 doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to
f01-081-00 We must beware , however , of supposing that there must be any
f01-081-01 close analogy between the units of quite different
f01-081-02 sciences . For example the success of the atomic theory
f01-081-03 in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
f01-081-04 units of geometry must be points . It would be more
f01-081-05 correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
f01-085-00 There have been many conflicting tendencies in
f01-085-01 psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
f01-085-02 we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
f01-085-03 concept which is current today . It is known as the schema .
f01-085-04 It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
f01-085-05 concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
f01-085-06 but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction .
f01-135-00 It is the tendency to get things
f01-135-01 the wrong way round . As a
f01-135-02 psychologist I am constantly
f01-135-03 encountering this tendency
f01-135-04 in friends and acquaintances .
f01-135-05 They think there is something
f01-135-06 inevitably " queer " about psychology
f01-135-07 and this feeling of queerness
f01-135-08 usually boils down to a quite
f01-135-09 mistaken belief that the
f01-135-10 psychologist first looks into ...
f01-143-00 And so they prefer objective methods . Since they cannot
f01-143-01 directly look into the mental processes of another
f01-143-02 person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
f01-143-03 to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
f01-143-04 this behaviour . This is no more queer than the method
f01-143-05 of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,
f01-143-06 and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .
f01-147-00 He may never have had the disease himself but he
f01-147-01 can nevertheless identify it . Similarly the psychologist has
f01-147-02 to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
f01-147-03 all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they
f01-147-04 correspond with anything in his own experience . We know
f01-147-05 very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
f01-147-06 provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as
f01-147-07 psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
f02-000-00 The numerically largest group , consisting of male
f02-000-01 weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level
f02-000-02 and in the works only , excluding the offices , was
f02-000-03 therefore selected . A detailed age-structure was
f02-000-04 compiled from personnel department records ,
f02-000-05 revealing that there were ( at that time ) seven-
f02-000-06 teen men seventy years of age or older ,
f02-000-07 thirty-three aged sixty-four years , and sixty-
f02-000-08 five just fifty years of age .
f02-003-00 A small panel was formed , not on a formally representative
f02-003-01 basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals ,
f02-003-02 from various levels in the firm . In due course
f02-003-03 the panel decided to seek further insight into the
f02-003-04 problems faced by older workers , and approached
f02-003-05 those seventy years of age or older .
f02-017-00 The Rubery , Owen scheme is now in its
f02-017-01 fourth year , and opportunity has been taken
f02-017-02 to revise the course in the light of
f02-017-03 experience . Topics for the six weekly meetings
f02-017-04 of one-and-a-half hours ( each held half in
f02-017-05 company time , half in the man's time ) are
f02-017-06 now as follows : 1 . Personal adjustment 2 . Health
f02-017-07 3 . Work and leisure 4 . Living arrangements
f02-017-08 5 . Financial planning 6 . Final discussion
f02-033-00 The latter do not regard themselves as expert
f02-033-01 advisers , but are prepared to seek out the
f02-033-02 appropriate sources of information or advice .
f02-033-03 Towards the end of 1956 , Mr. Daniel Grant ,
f02-033-04 an Employee Relations Officer of
f02-033-05 Rolls-Royce Ltd. and a member of the
f02-033-06 Workers' Educational Association , submitted
f02-033-07 to the Lord Provost of Glasgow , Dr. Andrew
f02-033-08 Hood , a copy of his report on an enquiry
f02-033-09 he had made into the problems that beset
f02-033-10 older workers and the effects of retirement
f02-020-00 The weekend conference for the men and their wives ,
f02-020-01 which takes place at company expense in a country or
f02-020-02 resort hotel , includes an address on ' The Woman's Point
f02-020-03 of View ' and one on ' Making the Most of Health ' . Separate
f02-020-04 discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
f02-020-05 plenary sessions . Of the men reaching fifty years of age
f02-020-06 since the scheme started , 125 ( 37.2 per cent ) have
f02-030-00 The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
f02-030-01 fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty :
f02-030-02 the first of these is due in 1963 . Meanwhile , each
f02-030-03 ' graduate ' is encouraged to seek help and advice in
f02-030-04 working out his ideas , either through the company's
f02-030-05 personnel department or by an approach to
f02-030-06 members of the panel responsible for the scheme .
f02-036-00 The Lord Provost , having studied the report on ' The Morale and
f02-036-01 Health of Retired Workers ' , and being satisfied that the matters
f02-036-02 raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
f02-036-03 Glasgow and warranted further study , set an informal
f02-036-04 committee representative of bodies particularly concerned with
f02-036-05 the welfare of older people to examine the report and
f02-036-06 its implications and to consider the advisability of
f02-036-07 arranging a Conference on Preparation for and
f02-036-08 Occupational Activities on Retirement .
f02-038-00 The large attendance and atmosphere of
f02-038-01 this Conference , held in October , 1957 ,
f02-038-02 reflected not only an increasing awareness
f02-038-03 of the problems of men and women nearing
f02-038-04 or already in retirement but also a strong
f02-038-05 desire on the part of all concerned for
f02-038-06 concerted action towards preparing men
f02-038-07 and women for life in retirement and more
f02-038-08 adequate provision of facilities for
f02-038-09 crafts , hobbies and leisure-time interests
f02-038-10 for those who are retired .
f02-040-00 As a result , the Glasgow Retirement Council came
f02-040-01 into being in April , 1958 , with Dr. Andrew Hood as
f02-040-02 chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary . The
f02-040-03 Council has active committees on Education and
f02-040-04 Preparation for Retirement , and on Occupational
f02-040-05 Centres . The former consists of representatives from
f02-040-06 the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department ;
f02-040-07 the Workers' Educational Association ; the University
f02-040-08 Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments
f02-040-09 of psychology , education and social science ; ... .
f02-044-00 In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks , Assistant Director
f02-044-01 of Education for Glasgow , that industrial firms might be ready
f02-044-02 to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
f02-044-03 for retirement , their wages paid for the time thus spent . An
f02-044-04 approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
f02-044-05 tober , 1959 , the first experimental day-release course for
f02-044-06 men was organised . Eleven students from seven firms atten-
f02-044-07 ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
f02-044-08 to the men and their employers that the venture was an
f02-044-09 experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
f02-076-00 1 . Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
f02-076-01 and retirement according to the occupational
f02-076-02 level of employees ? 2 . If so , which occupational
f02-076-03 levels are the better or the poorer prepared
f02-076-04 for successful adjustment to retirement and
f02-076-05 in what aspects ? 3 . Does the evidence
f02-076-06 obtained support a rationale for adapting
f02-076-07 a pre-retirement planning and preparation
f02-076-08 programme to the needs of older employees
f02-076-09 of different occupational levels ?
f03-169-00 Each time you rehearse you will probably put
f03-169-01 things in a different way . All the better ! - it will
f03-169-02 sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
f03-169-03 itself . Remember your four names - have the list
f03-169-04 with you if you like - and you simply can't
f03-169-05 be flummoxed ! Of course , in any speech a good
f03-169-06 start and a good finish are half the battle .
f03-174-00 So - see the next page ! Yes , they are waiting for you .
f03-174-01 But there is no need to be frightened . The audience
f03-174-02 will eat out of your hand - if they like what
f03-174-03 you offer them . A good start will put them in a
f03-174-04 good humour . Ladies and gentlemen ! I 'm afraid
f03-174-05 I have not had much experience of public speaking .
f03-182-00 But that 's a terrible way to begin ! Why tell them you
f03-182-01 are a novice ? It 's their interest you want - not their
f03-182-02 sympathy . And you want to get it from the word
f03-182-03 GO ! Try something like this : It is said that tele-
f03-182-04 vision keeps people at home . But you , at any
f03-182-05 rate , have proved that wrong . And they say , too ,
f03-182-06 that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
f03-191-00 May I suggest that you have proved that
f03-191-01 right ! Congratulations ! And away you go into
f03-191-02 your speech . Take some thought , too , for your ending .
f03-191-03 Thank you for listening to me so patiently . A political
f03-191-04 candidate often used that finish . No wonder he
f03-191-05 didn't get in ! Instead he might have ended
f03-191-06 this way : Well , those are my views .
f04-004-00 When he learned what was causing the commotion he
f04-004-01 became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been
f04-004-02 taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
f04-004-03 grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
f04-004-04 Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have
f04-004-05 been his bride . There was little doubt of how
f04-004-06 she had met her death , and even less that it
f04-011-00 The body was examined , and it was definitely
f04-011-01 established that no sexual assault had taken place .
f04-011-02 It seemed probable that the motive had been
f04-011-03 robbery , and this was further confirmed when a
f04-011-04 check was made with the woman's relations in
f04-011-05 Hounslow . Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
f04-011-06 Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth . Her day
f04-011-07 off was Thursday , and before coming up to London
f04-011-08 in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,
f04-011-09 one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
f04-011-10 other at Hounslow , where she kept a shop .
f04-016-00 Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,
f04-016-01 and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M. , where
f04-016-02 she had tea with her other sister , and then
f04-016-03 went to catch the 7.42 . Her sister saw her
f04-016-04 to the station , helping her with some of
f04-016-05 her packages . This sister was able to establish
f04-016-06 that she had carried a green purse and
f04-016-07 had bought a railway ticket .
f04-007-00 She had been struck several times with a blunt
f04-007-01 instrument , and her head was smashed in .
f04-007-02 There were signs of a violent struggle , blood
f04-007-03 on the cushions and floor , and the remains
f04-007-04 of her broken umbrella . But a pair of bone
f04-007-05 cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
f04-007-06 to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
g04-007-00 The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter
g04-007-01 when the distance to the church deterred many from
g04-007-02 coming to Sunday Evensong . We managed to furnish
g04-007-03 a table with cross and candles , and the people
g04-007-04 appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
g04-007-05 as for more secular purposes . In 1910 Dr. Talbot
g04-007-06 was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert
g04-007-07 Burge became Bishop of Southwark .
g04-011-00 Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
g04-011-01 work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and
g04-011-02 to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
g04-011-03 Union . This meant organizing lectures and courses of
g04-011-04 religious instruction through the Diocese , and I
g04-011-05 also found myself a member of the Diocesan
g04-011-06 Conference , where I remember introducing myself as
g04-011-07 the incumbent of the highest church in the
g04-014-00 There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
g04-014-01 some quarters , until I explained that my church
g04-014-02 was 800 feet high above the sea level ! The
g04-014-03 work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed
g04-014-04 to get a stipendiary layman who could help
g04-014-05 among the children and young people .
g04-095-00 Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
g04-095-01 me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
g04-095-02 lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
g04-095-03 continuing till old age to-day . When I went
g04-095-04 to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was
g04-095-05 with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton
g04-095-06 and his family , the youngest of whose three
g04-095-07 sons was just coming into the world in this year
f04-020-00 But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body
f04-020-01 was found at Waterloo . Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
f04-020-02 likely that she had been carrying much money . A porter at Hounslow
f04-020-03 supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
f04-020-04 compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it
f04-020-05 had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
g04-017-00 It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
g04-017-01 in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play . The place and its people were
g04-017-02 to play an important part in my life . For five years in succession till
g04-017-03 war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became
g04-017-04 very intimate with the people and the environs . Every year between the
g04-017-05 Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be
g04-017-06 performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would
g04-026-00 First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
g04-026-01 any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an
g04-026-02 old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quite well
g04-026-03 and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to
g04-026-04 teach by singing the parts with them . It was very amusing , and by
g04-026-05 the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
g04-026-06 could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
g04-032-00 Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
g04-032-01 Wedding Feast . ' Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we
g04-032-02 gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,
g04-032-03 and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
g04-032-04 Friends from Limpsfield , in addition to the villagers , came up ,
h04-025-00 For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
h04-025-01 in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
h04-025-02 four or more children , compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958
h04-025-03 and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957 . As with the price of energy index ,
h04-025-04 the only noteworthy change was for households with three children ,
h04-025-05 in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
f04-024-00 The police began a systematic search of the line -
f04-024-01 no easy task , but one in which patience and method
f04-024-02 paid off . At a spot on the embankment between
f04-024-03 Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
f04-024-04 pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs
f04-024-05 sticking to it . The murder weapon , more than likely ,
f04-024-06 and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
f04-028-00 But in 1897 , alas ! there was no fingerprint bureau ,
f04-028-01 no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it
f04-028-02 might have yielded . It was a tough case to
f04-028-03 tackle , and Superintendent Robinson , of the L.S.W.R.
f04-028-04 Police , and Chief Inspector Marshall , of Scotland
f04-028-05 Yard , combined forces in the investigation . While
f04-028-06 accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
f04-028-07 attacked for the sake of robbery , they did not
f04-028-08 overlook the possibility that this might have
f04-028-09 disguised another motive , and a thorough check
f04-028-10 of her former men friends and acquaintances began .
g04-077-00 Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
g04-077-01 were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen . Life was
g04-077-02 in those years more than busy . We now had a vicarage next
g04-077-03 to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight
g04-077-04 years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
g04-077-05 well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
g04-081-00 On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
g04-081-01 Purley she offered to come and look after me . She was
g04-081-02 a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic
g04-081-03 things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '
g04-081-04 who was the only other occupant of the house when
g04-088-00 We gathered together a splendid Sunday
g04-088-01 afternoon service at the church , each child
g04-088-02 being given a number which , as they came into
g04-088-03 church , they could just whisper to
g04-088-04 the superintendent who filled in the regi-
g04-088-05 ster at her own home . Each child had a
g04-088-06 picture given them and the lesson was
g04-088-07 largely based on this . It was on a
g04-088-08 stamp which could be stuck in
g04-088-09 their book , and there was quite a
g04-088-10 clamour for back stamps if a child
g04-088-11 had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
g04-092-00 It was quite amusing to see how much
g04-092-01 the children enjoyed the service , and I heard
g04-092-02 of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
g04-092-03 naughty child with the penalty of not being
g04-092-04 allowed to come to the Children's Church
g04-092-05 on Sunday afternoon . I hope the threat
g04-092-06 kept them good in the week , but anyway
g04-092-07 they were a most delightful lot , and
g04-092-08 it is a great joy to meet them now
g04-092-09 fifty years afterwards when so many
g04-092-10 are parents or even grandparents
g04-098-00 From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
g04-098-01 deep friendship which I have taken with me through
g04-098-02 all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry . Mr. and
g04-098-03 Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
g04-098-04 years of war , when most lives were upset and
g04-098-05 some tempers were easily frayed , the most
g04-098-06 loyal and devoted friends .
g04-101-00 Their homes - for since those years they have
g04-101-01 lived on in Purley - have always been
g04-101-02 havens of rest , and the welcome has never
g04-101-03 failed . Their three boys , now successful men ,
g04-101-04 were in our Children's Church from the
g04-101-05 outset , and when we don't see one
g04-101-06 another we do not forget .
g04-104-00 In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full
g04-104-01 both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
g04-104-02 The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in
g04-104-03 Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards
g04-104-04 at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners .
g04-104-05 I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them
g04-104-06 frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with
g04-104-07 the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
g04-104-08 someone who knew their native villages .
g04-108-00 I could at once notice the great antagonism
g04-108-01 between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
g04-108-02 scorned these more simple country folk .
h04-007-00 Compared with 1958 , the expenditure index for 1959
h04-007-01 showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
h04-007-02 children and those with one child , and much smaller
h04-007-03 changes for couples with several children . The quantity
h04-007-04 index , which has risen only slowly since 1956 , was
h04-007-05 almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
h04-007-06 children , but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult
h04-007-07 households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
h04-007-08 couples and couples with one child .
h04-021-00 As in 1958 , younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
h04-021-01 more per calorie than the national average , and families
h04-021-02 with four or more children 19 per cent less . The only
h04-021-03 substantial change was in families with three children ,
h04-021-04 for whom the index declined from 91 to 88 . Table 27
h04-021-05 also shows the corresponding values of an index which
h04-021-06 compares the prices paid by different types of household
h04-021-07 for the commodities constituting the average household
g05-087-00 Less than no response from the Russian side led
g05-087-01 one to fear that the event might well have the
g05-087-02 outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
g05-087-03 lead to disaster . Then there had been much talk of
g05-087-04 the setting up among the German population of a
g05-087-05 general system of " francs-tireurs " , to be named
g06-011a-00 By the end of the month he still delighted in
g06-011a-01 Naples . He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
g06-011a-02 much as his health permitted him to enjoy any-
g06-011a-03 thing . ' The Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which
g06-011a-04 is a great resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ;
g06-011a-05 # he is going out fast ... . What a gay , lively
g06-011a-06 people , and what a busy town . At Rome , every
g06-011a-07 other man was a priest : here the priest is
g06-011a-08 1superceded by the soldier - a favourable change
g06-011a-09 in my eye , particularly as the troops are very
g06-018a-00 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl
g06-018a-01 back to England , and returned to Rome for the
g06-018a-02 winter . In late November , he was ' suffering as
g06-018a-03 usual ' , but hoped , he told Arthur , ' to find
g06-018a-04 this place agree with me better than Naples .
g06-018a-05 The journey has been against me , as there has
g06-018a-06 been much rain and damp , but the temperature
g06-018a-07 is high & I have not yet thought of a fire ... .
g06-026a-00 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I
g06-026a-01 have an Italian who is perhaps the best Valet
g06-026a-02 de Chambre that ever was . But he has not
g06-026a-03 one word of English . ' While he was writing
g06-026a-04 this letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs , and the
g06-026a-05 temporary assumption of the government by
g06-031a-00 ' What a frightful event ! ' he wrote . ' I tremble !
g06-031a-01 What infatuation ! Personally I am indifferent , but
g06-031a-02 I really tremble for my country ! I may be
g06-031a-03 mistaken , 1tho' I cannot but fear that the
g06-031a-04 exasperation of the People will be so great at the
g06-031a-05 return of Ultratoryism , that the Commons House
g06-031a-06 upon a dissolution , which must be had , will be
g06-031a-07 a mass of Radicalism , & then God knows
g06-042a-00 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today ,
g06-042a-01 in the 1960s , no cure has been found for
g06-042a-02 the 6tic douloureux . As early as 1830 , when
g06-042a-03 Anglesey believed himself to be on the point
g06-042a-04 of death , the new German curative method
g06-042a-05 known as homoeopathy had been brought to
g06-045a-00 In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law ,
g06-045a-01 the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to
g06-045a-02 advise Anglesey to give the system a trial , adding
g06-045a-03 that it was being cultivated with extraordinary
g06-045a-04 success in France and Italy , and that he
g06-045a-05 himself was being treated under a doctor who
g06-045a-06 had studied under its founder , the aged
g06-047a-00 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis
g06-047a-01 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later
g06-047a-02 as ' more like a God upon earth than a human
g06-047a-03 being ' , had an increasing number of disciples
g06-047a-04 among unorthodox medical men in the cities
g06-047a-05 of Europe . One of these was the Neapolitan ,
g06-047a-06 Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey consulted
g06-050a-00 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
g06-050a-01 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice .
g06-050a-02 In doing so he described his distinguished patient
g06-050a-03 and his symptoms . He told Hahnemann that he
g06-050a-04 found Anglesey a strong , energetic man with a
g06-050a-05 gentle and charming character , even-tempered
g06-050a-06 and sedate , not easily irritated , patient and
g06-050a-07 persevering , ' but he appears to despair of ever
g06-011b-00 By the end of the month he still delighted
g06-011b-01 in Naples . He told Cloncurry that he
g06-011b-02 enjoyed it as much as his health
g06-011b-03 permitted him to enjoy anything . ' The Pearl ' ,
g06-011b-04 he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011b-05 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he

g06-037b-04 While he was in Naples there had opened
g06-037b-05 a new chapter in the history of
g06-037b-06 Anglesey's unceasing search for an effective
g06-037b-07 alleviation of his painful malady . None
g06-037b-08 of the numerous conventional remedies
g06-037b-09 to which he had been subjected ever
g06-042b-00 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even
g06-042b-01 today , in the 1960s , no cure has been
g06-042b-02 found for the 6tic douloureux . As early
g06-042b-03 as 1830 , when Anglesey believed himself
g06-042b-04 to be on the point of death , the new
g06-042b-05 German curative method known as
g06-042b-06 homoeopathy had been brought to
g06-045b-00 In April of that year his first wife's
g06-045b-01 brother-in-law , the diplomatist Lord
g06-045b-02 Ponsonby , had written to advise Anglesey to
g06-045b-03 give the system a trial , adding that it
g06-045b-04 was being cultivated with extraordinary
g06-045b-05 success in France and Italy , and that
g06-045b-06 he himself was being treated under a
g06-045b-07 doctor who had studied under its
g06-045b-08 founder , the aged Dr. Samuel
g06-047b-00 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis
g06-047b-01 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two
g06-047b-02 later as ' more like a God upon earth than
g06-047b-03 a human being ' , had an increasing number
g06-047b-04 of disciples among unorthodox medical men
g06-047b-05 in the cities of Europe . One of these
g06-047b-06 was the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mauro ,
g06-047b-07 whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
g06-050b-00 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
g06-050b-01 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for
g06-050b-02 advice . In doing so he described his distinguished
g06-050b-03 patient and his symptoms . He told Hahnemann
g06-050b-04 that he found Anglesey a strong , energetic man
g06-050b-05 with a gentle and charming character ,
g06-050b-06 even-tempered and sedate , not easily irritated ,
g06-050b-07 patient and persevering , ' but he appears to
g06-050b-08 despair of ever being cured . '
g06-011c-00 By the end of the month he still delighted in
g06-011c-01 Naples . He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
g06-011c-02 much as his health permitted him to enjoy anything .
g06-011c-03 ' The Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011c-04 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he is going
g06-011c-05 out fast ... . What a gay , lively people , and what
g06-011c-06 a busy town . At Rome , every other man was a
g06-011c-07 priest : here the priest is 1superceded by the
g06-011c-08 soldier - a favourable change in my eye , particularly
g06-011c-09 as the troops are very fine . '
g06-018c-00 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl back
g06-018c-01 to England , and returned to Rome for the winter . In
g06-018c-02 late November , he was ' suffering as usual ' , but hoped ,
g06-018c-03 he told Arthur , ' to find this place agree with

g06-047g-02 ' more like a God upon earth than a human being ' , had an
g06-047g-03 increasing number of disciples among unorthodox medical
g06-047g-04 men in the cities of Europe . One of these was the Neapolitan ,
g06-047g-05 Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
g06-050g-00 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master
g06-050g-01 at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice . In doing so he
g06-050g-02 described his distinguished patient and his symptoms . He told
g06-050g-03 Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a strong , energetic man
g06-050g-04 with a gentle and charming character , even-tempered and
g06-050g-05 sedate , not easily irritated , patient and persevering , ' but he
g06-050g-06 appears to despair of ever being cured . '
g06-011h-00 By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples .
g06-011h-01 He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as
g06-011h-02 his health permitted him to enjoy anything . ' The
g06-011h-03 Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011h-04 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he is
g06-011h-05 going out fast ... . What a gay , lively people , and
g06-011h-06 what a busy town . At Rome , every other man
g06-011h-07 was a priest : here the priest is 1superceded by
g06-011h-08 the soldier - a favourable change in my eye ,
g06-011h-09 particularly as the troops are very fine . '
g06-018h-00 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl back to
g06-018h-01 England , and returned to Rome for the winter . In late
g06-018h-02 November , he was ' suffering as usual ' , but hoped , he
g06-018h-03 told Arthur , ' to find this place agree with me better

g06-047l-02 ' more like a God upon earth than a human being ' ,
g06-047l-03 had an increasing number of disciples among
g06-047l-04 unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe .
g06-047l-05 One of these was the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mauro ,
g06-047l-06 whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
g06-050l-00 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
g06-050l-01 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice .
g06-050l-02 In doing so he described his distinguished patient and
g06-050l-03 his symptoms . He told Hahnemann that he found
g06-050l-04 Anglesey a strong , energetic man with a gentle and
g06-050l-05 charming character , even-tempered and sedate ,
g06-050l-06 not easily irritated , patient and persevering ,
g06-050l-07 ' but he appears to despair of ever being cured . '
g06-011m-00 By the end of the month he still delighted in
g06-011m-01 Naples . He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
g06-011m-02 much as his health permitted him to enjoy anything .
g06-011m-03 ' The Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011m-04 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he is going
g06-011m-05 out fast ... . What a gay , lively people , and what a
g06-011m-06 busy town . At Rome , every other man was a
g06-011m-07 priest : here the priest is 1superceded by the
g06-011m-08 soldier - a favourable change in my eye ,
g06-011m-09 particularly as the troops are very fine . '
g06-018m-00 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl
g06-018m-01 back to England , and returned to Rome for the
g06-018m-02 winter . In late November , he was ' suffering as
g06-018m-03 usual ' , but hoped , he told Arthur , ' to find this
g06-018m-04 place agree with me better than Naples . The journey
g06-018m-05 has been against me , as there has been much
g06-018m-06 rain and damp , but the temperature is high
g06-018m-07 & I have not yet thought of a fire ... .
g06-026m-00 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that
g06-026m-01 I have an Italian who is perhaps the best
g06-026m-02 Valet de Chambre that ever was . But he has
g06-026m-03 not one word of English . ' While he was writing
g06-026m-04 this letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs , and
g06-026m-05 the temporary assumption of the government
g06-026m-06 by the Duke of Wellington .
g06-031m-00 ' What a frightful event ! ' he wrote . ' I tremble ! What
g06-031m-01 infatuation ! Personally I am indifferent , but I
g06-031m-02 really tremble for my country ! I may be mistaken ,
g06-031m-03 1tho' I cannot but fear that the exasperation of
g06-031m-04 the People will be so great at the return of
g06-031m-05 Ultratoryism , that the Commons House upon a
g06-031m-06 dissolution , which must be had , will be a
g06-031m-07 mass of Radicalism , & then God knows
g06-037m-00 God grant , however , that I may be a false
g06-037m-01 prophet & that all may go well . Sir R. Peel
g06-037m-02 was here , I understand , but an express took
g06-037m-03 him off yesterday . ' While he was in Naples
g06-037m-04 there had opened a new chapter in the
g06-037m-05 history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an
g06-037m-06 effective alleviation of his painful malady .
g06-037m-07 None of the numerous conventional remedies to
g06-037m-08 which he had been subjected ever since the
g06-037m-09 symptoms had first shown themselves seventeen
g06-037m-10 years before had had the slightest effect .
g06-042m-00 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today ,
g06-042m-01 in the 1960s , no cure has been found for the
g06-042m-02 6tic douloureux . As early as 1830 , when
g06-042m-03 Anglesey believed himself to be on the
g06-042m-04 point of death , the new German curative
g06-042m-05 method known as homoeopathy had
g06-042m-06 been brought to his notice .
g06-045m-00 In April of that year his first wife's
g06-045m-01 brother-in-law , the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby ,
g06-045m-02 had written to advise Anglesey to give the
g06-045m-03 system a trial , adding that it was being
g06-045m-04 cultivated with extraordinary success in
g06-045m-05 France and Italy , and that he himself was
g06-045m-06 being treated under a doctor who had
g06-045m-07 studied under its founder , the aged
g06-047m-00 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir
g06-047m-01 Francis Burdett described to Anglesey a
g06-047m-02 year or two later as ' more like a God
g06-047m-03 upon earth than a human being ' , had an
g06-047m-04 increasing number of disciples among
g06-047m-05 unorthodox medical men in the cities of
g06-047m-06 Europe . One of these was the Neapolitan ,
g06-047m-07 Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey
g06-047m-08 consulted in May 1834 .
g06-050m-00 Mauro's first action was to write to his
g06-050m-01 revered master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking
g06-050m-02 for advice . In doing so he described his
g06-050m-03 distinguished patient and his symptoms . He
g06-050m-04 told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a
g06-050m-05 strong , energetic man with a gentle and
g06-050m-06 charming character , even-tempered and
g06-050m-07 sedate , not easily irritated , patient and
g06-050m-08 persevering , ' but he appears to despair
p06-242-00 Philip bristled . ' It was never our intention
p06-242-01 to have one of those carnival affairs , ' he
p06-242-02 retorted and in that second , he became the man of
p06-242-03 success exerting authority . Sandra watched her father's
p06-242-04 face pale . Philip , she knew , got on his nerves , but
p06-242-05 everything had gone over her head . It didn't really
p06-242-06 matter what was being said because she was
p06-248-00 The thought of Nicholas haunted her , the sense of
p06-248-01 loss crucifying . Her father's comment roused her as
p06-248-02 he said , ' I was not talking of a carnival . But I
p06-248-03 presume we shall be allowed to have one or two
p06-248-04 of our friends at the ceremony . '
r06-000-00 Vence is a sober spot , half way between small
r06-000-01 town and village , pigeon grey , sly with arches , and
r06-000-02 linked by a whispering plot of fountains . In the main
r06-000-03 tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn
r06-000-04 sunshine , still burning like a half-cooled iron ,
r06-000-05 sip pastis and read the local newspapers .
r06-003-00 One called La Patriote is Communist , and at the time
r06-003-01 of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal
r06-003-02 tomatoes at General de Gaulle . One side of this square
r06-003-03 is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar . For one
r06-003-04 day , with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative , we had been
r06-003-05 hunting for furnished rooms , and had given up , when an
r06-003-06 elderly lady , the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest ,
r06-003-07 had firmly closed the door in our noses .
r06-007-00 ' It is a pity , ' said Mart , ' because it would have been
r06-007-01 a good address . ' Now , after a woman's radar look ,
r06-007-02 she decided Pierre would solve our problems . This
r06-007-04 yellow as lemon peel , wrestling with some gnawing rat
r06-007-05 of an illness , man of all trades , married to a commanding
r06-007-06 lady who loved small talk and the discreet
r06-011-00 We went in . There were a few people in the bar ,
r06-011-01 elderly , well-off , artistic , who , you felt , had made a hard
r06-011-02 bargain for giving up . ' I have furnished rooms , ' said
r06-011-03 Pierre , ' and all mod cons . ' The price was 16,000 francs a
r06-011-04 month . ' Yes , ' we said immediately , even before viewing .
r06-018-01 6al view ; good intimate furnishing and colour ; running
r06-018-02 hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up ,
r06-018-03 basin and bidet ; own private , modern lavatory . The
r06-018-04 first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence .
r06-018-05 We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
r06-022-00 This was strange , even magic , because the owner's
r06-022-01 name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means
r06-022-02 ' turtledove ' . Pierre Turtledove . When we woke up properly it
r06-022-03 was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we
r06-022-04 looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
r06-022-05 curling white breath of the mountains . The land looked
r06-022-06 like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
r06-027-00 There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them .
r06-027-01 Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two
r06-027-02 immolated on a nearby roof top , the other pair copulating .
r06-027-03 We had a morning at Pierre's . He talked about people .
r06-027-04 Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
r06-027-05 Lawrence . He was here , near the railway station , three or
r06-027-06 four years . During this period he wrote a book ,
r06-143-00 In the train going back to London I sat
r06-143-01 beside # Catherine . She had the stories open
r06-143-02 in front of her , but she said : ' Philip 's awfully lucky .
r06-143-03 I wish I went to that school . Did you notice
r06-143-04 that girl who said hullo to him in the garden ?
r02-000-00 He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions
r02-000-01 drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those
r02-000-02 self-employed . By the time his monthly salary
r02-000-03 arrived , the Inland Revenue had already taken
r02-000-04 their share , and there were precious few
r02-000-05 reductions in tax save for wives , children ,
r02-000-06 life-insurances or any of the other normal
r02-000-07 encumbrances which Cecil had so far avoided .
r02-003-00 He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
r02-003-01 provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
r02-003-02 to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases , but also
r02-003-03 postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
r02-003-04 was ended , audited and agreed by the Inspector . The
r02-003-05 process could , and often did take several years .
r02-006-00 At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake
r02-006-01 had claimed tax relief on the pur-
r02-006-02 chase of several mink coats which ,
r02-006-03 it seemed , were necessary to fur-
r02-006-04 ther her career . Alternatively , it
r02-006-05 was reported , she tearfully claimed
r02-006-06 that the warm coats were heating
r02-006-07 appliances and therefore susceptible
r02-006-08 to a depreciation tax allowance
r02-006-09 as plant and machinery . The
r02-010-00 Between all the interested parties , the final
r02-010-01 agreement had been delayed long enough for
r02-010-02 Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which
r02-010-03 by rights should have been reserved for her tax .
r02-010-04 Discounting one chinchilla jacket , a Rolls-
r02-010-05 Royce and a Sussex manor house , all
r02-010-06 three of which were in her husband's name ,
r02-010-07 she now declared herself bankrupt .
r02-013-00 The train drew into another station
r02-013-01 and Cecil , with a further six stops
r02-013-02 to go , was left almost alone in the
r02-013-03 coach . He fumed as he recol-
r02-013-04 lected the long correspondence he
r02-013-05 had had with the Inland Reve-
r02-013-06 nue in an effort to obtain
r02-013-07 tax relief for a jacket used
r02-013-08 solely in the office . ' If the jacket
r02-013-09 is a condition of your employment , '
r02-013-10 the Inspector had written , ' it may
r02-013-11 qualify for relief . '
r02-038-00 ' It 's not mine . I wasn't sitting there . ' She blinked
r02-038-01 disdainfully at him and stepped out .
r02-038-02 It was a new briefcase , and as the train jogged along
r02-038-03 the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil .
r02-038-04 He wondered what it contained . Probably the remains
r02-038-05 of someone's lunch or a few secret files .
r02-054-00 It was locked . Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
r02-054-01 when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
r02-054-02 of wads of paper . ' Cor ! ' he muttered aloud , ' there 's
r02-054-03 five thousand at least . ' He felt in his jacket pocket
r02-054-04 and pulled out a key ring . In succession he tried
r02-054-05 his own briefcase key , a suitcase key and a
r02-054-06 device designed to lock typewriters .
r02-060-00 Cecil searched in his pockets once
r02-060-01 more and came up with two
r02-060-02 paper-clips . After a few seconds
r02-060-03 of twisting , he roughly thrust a
r02-060-04 bent wire loop into the lock and
r02-060-05 waggled it around vigorously .
r02-060-06 There was a click and the
r02-060-07 briefcase opened . Cecil thrust an
r02-060-08 eager hand inside , his fingers
r02-060-09 groping after wads of five
r02-065-00 They closed on a single bundle and , fumbling with
r02-065-01 nervous excitement , he pulled it out . His eye
r02-065-02 rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
r02-065-03 side . ' Old fashioned fivers ! ' he muttered again , and
r02-065-04 tried to recall if they were still legal tender . Surely the
r02-065-05 Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
r02-065-06 break their promise to pay on rude demand , let
r02-070-00 Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon the
r02-070-01 printing to find no Govr. , no Compa. , in fact no five pound notes
r02-070-02 at all . He was holding a paper booklet , the top sheet of which
r02-070-03 bore , in large Baskerville type , the words METROPOLITAN
r02-070-04 MONOTECHNIC INSTITUTE ADVANCED ACCOUNTANCY
r02-070-05 COURSE NO. 3 . He ruffled the sheets irritably and
r02-070-06 glowered at his own breach of social morality .
r02-078-00 He climbed the stairs , eager to unload the
r02-078-01 guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then
r02-078-02 to emerge carrying his shame unseen , but burning ,
r02-078-03 into the night . He reached the barrier and
r02-078-04 fumbled for his contract before thrusting the
r02-078-05 briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
r02-078-06 intention of playing the dutiful citizen
r02-081-01 Before he could open his mouth , the collector
r02-081-02 stretched out a hand . ' Watch your step there , sir ! Your briefcase
r02-081-03 is hanging open . You 'll have someone shoving their hot
r02-081-04 little hands inside . Here , I 'll do it . ' The collector pressed the twinkling
r02-081-05 catch home with a click . Cecil , irretrievably laden with
r02-081-06 both briefcase and conscience , stumbled away
r02-089-00 ' HELLO , CECIL . HAD a busy day ? ' His mother came into
r02-089-01 the hall as he opened the front door . He nodded irritably
r02-089-02 and , turning his back to her , contrived to slide the brief-
r02-089-03 case into hiding between the do-it-yourself cupboard
r02-089-04 and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
r02-089-05 which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-
r02-089-06 brella stand . ' You 're later than usual , aren't you ? '
r02-089-07 His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
r02-089-08 they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange
r02-089-09 for the labels from half a hundredweight of
r02-089-10 Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea .
r02-109-00 Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the
r02-109-01 inequity of Miss Cheesecake well-nigh bathing
r02-109-02 in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
r02-109-03 easy on the immersion heater . ' What is it ,
r02-109-04 Cecil ? Don't you feel well ? ' his mother
r02-109-05 asked solicitously . ' You do look tired .
r02-109-06 Go and get yourself a drink . ' ' Don't
r02-109-07 fuss , mother ! I 'm quite well and no more
r02-109-08 tired than usual , and we finished the gin
r02-109-09 last week , you know that . '
r02-117-00 Cecil stepped towards the dining room . ' I 'm
r02-117-01 sure you must be tired , ' his mother insisted .
r02-117-02 ' You 're very irritable , anyway . ' ' I 'm NOT tired
r02-117-03 and I 'm NOT irritable . ' ' Very well then . ' His
r02-117-04 mother nodded with understanding . ' You 're not tired .
r02-117-05 Nobody 's tired . Now just you run along
r02-117-06 upstairs and wash your hands whilst I get
r02-127-00 Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
r02-127-01 of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
r02-127-02 who is nearly bald is no longer a baby . He started to
r02-127-03 climb the stairs , stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
r02-127-04 the treads . ' And don't wipe the dirt off on the
r02-131-00 Your Auntie Edie 's coming in for a cup of tea later and
r02-131-01 you know how she has a good look round everywhere . ' There was
r02-131-02 a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard . Cecil's
r02-131-03 mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse
r02-131-04 against the brass umbrella stand . ' Well now ! ' She hurried
r02-131-05 towards it and picked it up .
r02-137-00 ' What have we here ? A new briefcase ! So THAT 'S
r02-137-01 what it 's all about . ' Cecil halted in
r02-137-02 mid-step near the top of the stairs and
r02-137-03 clenched his fists . ' So that 's what
r02-137-04 What 's all about ? ' he hissed without
r02-137-05 turning round . She pointed to the
r02-137-06 briefcase . ' So that 's why you are so
r02-137-07 irritable . You thought that I 'd think
r02-137-08 you 'd been extravagant . '
r02-146-00 ' But I 'm NOT irritable ! ' He rushed down
r02-146-01 the stairs and , snatching the case , ran back
r02-146-02 upstairs with it . ' And I 've NOT been
r02-146-03 extravagant . ' " Naughty ! ' she called
r02-146-04 after him . ' Mother knows her boy .
r03-002-00 In spite of all the transferred maternity
r03-002-01 she was endowed with by her patients ,
r03-002-02 poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as
r03-002-03 a buyer of property . No , not even an
r03-002-04 infant-in-arms but a new-born babe , a
r03-002-05 premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-
r03-002-06 tent of utter innocence . The complexity of
r03-002-07 that innocence was colossal . It had layer
r03-002-08 after layer of illusion to be peeled off and
r03-002-09 replaced with sad knowledgeability .
r03-007-00 It was a nakedness of nai"vety to be
r03-007-01 clothed leaf by leaf with the disappointment
r03-007-02 of experience . Her first illusion consisted in
r03-007-03 the belief that all she need do was to go to
r03-007-04 an agent , visit half a dozen houses in one
r03-007-05 day , choose one , make an offer , put it in
r03-007-06 the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
r03-007-07 holiday while the whole transaction was
r03-026-00 Fortunately , however , the fashion for Victorian
r03-026-01 architecture which Mr. John Betjeman had
r03-026-02 started several decades before had caught on
r03-026-03 at last and therefore saved the situation for
r03-026-04 the affluent middle-class , who now had plenty
r03-026-05 of lovely-ugly to be coldly elegant in . All this
r03-026-06 Serena discovered , and more , but in stages . For the
r03-026-07 first thing she did was to make an offer
r03-026-08 on a small pink terraced cottage , two beds ,
r03-026-09 two inter-comm. rec. , mod. k. and b. , sep. W.C.
r03-026-10 small back yard , newly dec. , near shops and tube
r03-030-00 The next thing that Serena discovered was that
r03-030-01 she could not afford to buy a house at all .
r03-030-02 And this in spite of having at last managed
r03-030-03 to save the ten percent needed . Or so she
r03-030-04 thought , being then in possession of what
r03-030-05 seemed to her the princely sum of six hund-
r03-030-06 red pounds . The lawyer said :
r03-035-00 " Of course you must count about two hundred
r03-035-01 for legal charges and stamp duties ,
r03-035-02 maybe less , depending on the price of the
r03-035-03 house , and whether it has been regis-
r03-035-04 tered . I take it you have a mortgage lined
r03-035-05 up , then , Mrs. - er - Buttery ? " " Not yet ,
r03-035-06 but the bank would give me a loan , I 'm
r03-035-07 sure . " " Er , yes . You have some securities ,
r03-035-08 then ? "
r03-050-00 His aspect was as dusty as his office , with scurf
r03-050-01 from dusty hair on the dusty shoulders of his black
r03-050-02 suit , cigarette ash down the front , an ashen face
r03-050-03 and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale
r03-050-04 grey eyes . His finger-nails were dirty , though he
r03-050-05 tried to make up for it by constantly paring them
r03-050-06 with the finger-nail of the opposite hand .
r03-056-00 " Yes , well ... . " He judged that she had been sufficiently
r03-056-01 dazzled and gave a long raucous cough . " Only
r03-056-02 cigarettes worth smoking , these . Most unhealthy , English
r03-056-03 ones . Well , now , let me see . I think I can put you onto
r03-056-04 some people who might , I say might , let you have a mortgage on
r03-056-05 this property ... . " " But , they 're safe , are they ? I mean ,
r03-056-06 they 're not - money-lenders ? " " Mrs. - er - Buttery ,
r03-056-07 all mortgage companies are money-lenders .
r03-065-00 That 's rather the point , isn't it ? " " No , but I mean - "
r03-065-01 " I know what you mean . You may trust me , Mrs.
r03-065-02 Buttery . I think , however , that you might have
r03-065-03 to revise your ideas about - er - the type of
r03-065-04 property you intend to purchase . " She revised
r03-065-05 them . The little man from the Inter-Insular
r03-065-06 ( British Archipelago ) Insurance Company soon
r03-084-00 I 'm afraid we can't take yours into account
r03-084-01 at all . It 's a rule of I.I.I. You see , you
r03-084-02 might stop work to have - well , for all sorts of
r03-084-03 reasons , or you might leave him . " " But how
r03-084-04 utterly extraordinary , " said Serena angrily ,
r03-084-05 " you must be living in the nineteenth century . "
r03-084-06 " Oh , but it 's a very general rule , Mrs. Buttery ,
r03-084-07 you 'll find that no insurance companies ,
r03-084-08 or building societies , for that matter , will
r03-084-09 allow for the wife's earnings .
r03-090-00 Our lawyers - " " Who are your lawyers ? "
r03-090-01 " Clacton's . " " Well , I 'm damned . " " Now , let me see ,
r03-090-02 you say your husband earns about ... yes ,
r03-090-03 that would come to ... three , carry seven , six
r03-090-04 nines are fifty four - of course we 'd have to
r03-090-05 have some sort of proof , you know , it 's very
r03-090-06 difficult with self-employed persons , carry two .
r03-096-00 Yes . I 'm afraid we couldn't raise this loan to more
r03-096-01 than three thousand three fifty at the most . Now you
r03-096-02 could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in
r03-096-03 Grimstead for three thousand , that 's where I live , just
r03-096-04 before the green belt , lovely and modern , you know .
r03-096-05 I forgot to tell you , we don't usually lend any
r03-096-06 house built earlier than 1918 . "
r03-110-00 " You see , " she propounded to Rupert after her last patient
r03-110-01 had gone , " we can get three thousand three fifty ,
r03-110-02 perhaps a little more if we can cheat your earnings
r03-110-03 a bit . I 'm sure you could raise the rest from
r03-110-04 one of your publishers , get two books commissioned
r03-110-05 and write them later . I 've got a bit owing too .
r03-110-06 Now , I saw some flats in Hendon for four thou ,
r03-110-07 and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty ,
r03-110-08 two beds , two reception , k. and b. , just think ,
r03-115-00 Much more spacious than that poky little cottage ,
r03-115-01 which wasn't a bit practical really , the
r03-115-02 reception room was too small when divided
r03-115-03 and too big when not .
r06-035-00 No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the
r06-035-01 reading . Lawrence died in this very place .
r06-035-02 He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
r06-035-03 again . No , he couldn't really remember
r06-035-04 him , he was one of the crowd . The
r06-035-05 sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I
r06-035-06 sat in the square reading the Patriote .
r06-041-00 There was a front-page rear-attack on de
r06-041-01 Gaulle , and the rest of the paper was given up
r06-041-02 to murders , apart for an outcry against a
r06-041-03 proposal to drop radio-active material into
r06-041-04 the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
r06-041-05 Raphael . All the murders were well documented
r06-041-06 and had the air of being written by an
r06-041-07 ingenious , but mad film director of the
r06-044-00 They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses .
r06-044-01 Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and
r06-044-02 throttled to death by his wife , children and
r06-044-03 father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep
r06-044-04 while the worse for drink . The family
r06-044-05 group then sat down for a late lunch
r06-044-06 before the father-in-law telephoned the police .
r06-044-07 Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family
r06-044-08 troubles , had written to the local
r06-044-09 paper and the superintendent of police ,
r06-044-10 informing them that he was on the point
r06-049-00 Monsieur V's house was immediately
r06-049-01 surrounded by firemen and other officials ,
r06-049-02 but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned
r06-049-03 a few minutes later from a nearby village ,
r06-049-04 apologising for the trouble , but explaining
r06-049-05 that the walls were porous and the
r06-049-06 gas had escaped . General relief was
r06-049-07 expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was
r06-049-08 actually reported in the next issue ) returned
r06-049-09 home and shot himself , leaving a note
r06-049-10 which again left his household goods
r06-053-00 Some grim comic relief was provided by
r06-053-01 an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
r06-053-02 who hid himself in a bush and imitated
r06-053-03 a blackbird . Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
r06-053-04 was after this very bird and shot the farm-
r06-053-05 labourer in the face . All , however ,
r06-053-06 ended well , reported the paper , since the
r06-053-07 pellets were easily removed and the
r06-053-08 labourer was able to return to work the
r06-057-00 We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta .
r06-057-01 You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
r06-057-02 way . In the middle of the journey is a
r06-057-03 valley with a sea of vines and olives
r06-057-04 and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
r06-057-05 the hoe . Rising from the flecked sea are
r06-057-06 islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
r06-057-07 towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging
r06-057-08 like limpets to the rock .
r06-062-00 There is a curd of morning smoke and
r06-062-01 a muffled bell taps the sky . Here we
r06-062-02 stopped , as in fine weather we always
r06-062-03 stopped . Down below is the village of
r06-062-04 Cagnes , but between are pockets of
r06-062-05 heat and cold like the hands of
r06-062-06 friends or strangers , and a flurry of
r06-062-07 early smells , the dark bosoms of
r06-062-08 beech and the thin pine fingers
r06-066-00 Then here was Nice , and the old holiday
r06-066-01 sea , blue as a new school exercise
r06-066-02 book . The same old Nice , creamy ,
r06-066-03 vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with
r06-066-04 the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
r06-066-05 prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur
r06-066-06 to the old sleeping port . This , and
r06-066-07 Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I
r06-066-08 could catch the taste of dead dreams on
r06-066-09 my tongue like spray .
r06-070-00 We parked the Lambretta opposite the
r06-070-01 Negresco , and went to the beach to
r06-070-02 have a swim . Amazing bedlam rocked
r06-070-03 in our eyes . The sea boiled with waves ,
r06-070-04 they galloped to the walls and spumed
r06-070-05 over the Promenade des Anglais . A huge
r06-070-06 crowd had collected . There were firemen
r06-070-07 and policemen and ambulances , and the
r06-070-08 eyes of the spectators were hard with
r06-076-00 They all had that neat look of
r06-076-01 Mediterranean people to whom nothing
r06-076-02 could ever happen , the chosen sane , the
r06-076-03 uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from
r06-076-04 disease and accident by doctors , God and
r06-076-05 the municipality . Yet , at any time now ,
r06-076-06 the bell would ring for them - the gilded
r06-076-07 love house , the mad grandmother or the
r06-076-08 bloody child at the crossroads .
r06-090-00 It was growing cold . We left the
r06-090-01 crowd and drove back to Vence .
r06-090-02 The cool evening perfumes stood
r06-090-03 beckoning at the corners of the roads .
r06-090-04 Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
r06-090-05 organs were impaired years ago ) , and
r06-090-06 I had to explain the low , sharp and
r06-090-07 sweet signals in the air . When we
r06-090-08 got back home we felt exhausted .
r06-090-09 London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,
r06-090-10 mingled with the memory of sandwiches
r06-097-00 We went straight to bed and slept until
r06-097-01 the turtle-doves drummed up the
r06-097-02 sun . The next morning , in the square
r06-097-03 opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice
r06-097-04 beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
r06-097-05 Mart had been right , the body had been
r06-097-06 a woman's . It belonged to a Madame
r06-097-07 N. Enquiries had been made in the
r06-097-08 neighbourhood , and it transpired that
r06-097-09 Madame N's husband had made an
r06-097-10 arrangement with the dead lady's sister
r06-103-00 The sister , able to swim , had returned
r06-103-01 to the shore , but instead of returning
r06-103-02 to her brother-in-law ( with whom
r06-103-03 she had an illicit relationship ) , she
r06-103-06 reported her to the police , and then jumped
r06-103-07 off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
r06-106-00 The day I promised to take Catherine
r06-106-01 down to visit my young friend Philip
r06-106-02 at his school in the country , we were
r06-106-03 to leave at eleven , but she arrived
r06-106-04 at nine . Her blue dress was new ,
r06-106-05 and so were her fashionable shoes . Her
r06-106-06 hair had just been done . She looked
r06-106-07 more than ever like a pink and gold
r06-106-08 Renoir girl who expects everything from
r06-111-00 Catherine lives in a white house
r06-111-01 overlooking the sweeping brown tides
r06-111-02 of the river . She helped me clean up my
r06-111-03 flat with a devotion which said that
r06-111-04 she felt small flats were altogether more
r06-111-05 romantic than large houses . We drank
r06-111-06 tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,
r06-111-07 being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every-
r06-111-08 thing from food to music .
r06-115-00 Catherine looked at the books lying
r06-115-01 around his room , and asked if she
r06-115-02 might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
r06-115-03 to read on the train . Catherine is 13 .
r06-115-04 I suggested she might find them dif-
r06-115-05 ficult , but she said , ' Philip reads them ,
r06-115-06 doesn't he ? ' During the journey I read
r06-115-07 newspapers and watched her pretty
r06-115-08 frowning face as she turned the
r06-115-09 pages of Babel , for she was determined
r06-115-10 to let nothing get between her and
r06-121-00 At the school , which is charming , ci-
r06-121-01 vilised and expensive , the two children
r06-121-02 walked together across green fields , and
r06-121-03 I followed , seeing how the sun gilded
r06-121-04 their bright friendly heads turned
r06-121-05 towards each other as they talked . In
r06-121-06 Catherine's left hand she carried the
r06-121-07 stories of Isaac Babel . After lunch we
r06-121-08 went to the pictures . Philip allowed
r06-121-09 # it to be seen that he thought going to
r06-121-10 the pictures just for the fun of it was
r06-126-00 For his sake we chose the more
r06-126-01 serious of the two films that were
r06-126-02 showing in the little town . It was
r06-126-03 about a good priest who helped cri-
r06-126-04 minals in New York . His goodness , how-
r06-126-05 ever , was not enough to prevent one
r06-126-06 of them from being sent to the gas
r06-126-07 chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
r06-126-08 Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
r06-126-09 crying and could face the light of a golden
r06-130-00 At the entrance of the cinema the
r06-130-01 doorman was lying in wait for anyone
r06-130-02 who had red eyes . Grasping Catherine
r06-130-03 by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :
r06-130-04 ' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be
r06-130-05 punished for his crime , didn't he ? ' Cathe-
r06-130-06 rine stared at him , incredulous . Philip
r06-130-07 rescued her by saying with disdain :
r06-130-08 ' Some people don't know right from wrong
r06-130-09 even when its demonstrated to them . '
r06-137-00 The doorman turned his attention
r06-137-01 to the next red-eyed emerger from the
r06-137-02 dark ; and we went on together to
r06-137-03 the station , the children silent because
r06-137-04 of the cruelty of the world . Finally Catherine
r06-137-05 said , her eyes wet again : ' I think its all
r06-137-06 absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think
r06-137-07 about it . ' And Philip said : ' But we 've got
r06-137-08 to think about it , don't you see , because
r06-137-09 if we don't it 'll just go on and on , don't
