c04-110-00 Become a success with a disc and hey presto ! You 're a star ... . Rolly sings with
c04-110-01 assuredness " Bella Bella Marie " ( Parlophone ) , a lively song that changes tempo mid-way .
c04-110-02 I don't think he will storm the charts with this one , but it 's a good start .
c04-110-03 CHRIS CHARLES , 39 , who lives in Stockton-on-Tees , is an accountant .
c04-116-00 He is also a director of a couple of garages . And he finds time as well to be a lyric
c04-116-01 writer . He writes with Tolchard Evans , composer of " Lady of Spain " and other big hits .
c04-116-02 Tolch , as he is known in Tin Pan Alley , likes songs with a month in the title . He wrote
c04-116-03 " My September Love , " the big David Whitfield hit of 1956 .
c04-134-00 The numbers include " Scotland the Brave , " " Men of Harlech , "
c04-134-01 " McNamara's Band , " " Greensleeves " and " English Rose . "
c04-134-02 Fay Compton stars in " No Hiding Place " ( I T V , 9.35 p.m. ) .
c04-134-03 She plays the possessive mother of a man whose hobby revolves
c04-134-04 round a doll's house .
c04-134-05 THREE people will be hypnotised in tonight's " Lifeline "
c04-134-06 ( B B C , 10.15 ) .
c04-139-00 They will be asked to comment on the design of everyday articles
c04-139-01 such as a chair and a motor-car . The idea is to see what happens when
c04-139-02 parts of the mind not normally available without hypnosis are used .
c04-139-03 I T V have postponed Malcolm Muggeridge's " Appointment with
c04-139-04 playwright Arnold Wesker . " Instead , Muggeridge's appointment
c04-139-05 will be with Sir Roy Welensky the Premier of the Federation
c04-139-06 of Rhodesia and Nyasaland ( 10.30 p.m. ) .
c04-144-00 Say Granada T V , the producers : " We decided to make
c04-144-01 the switch because of the topicality of African
c04-144-02 affairs . The Wesker interview will be seen at a later
c04-144-03 date . " ACTOR Tom Courtenay was an outstanding
c04-144-04 success last night in I T V's " Private Potter , " his
c04-144-05 first big T V part . The play was a brilliantly-written
c04-144-06 essay on soldiering which stated that a fighting
c04-144-07 man could only be regarded as a machine .
c04-150-00 Potter screamed during an action , and was arrested . He
c04-150-01 claimed he had seen a vision of God - only the padre and his
c04-150-02 C O believed him . Courtenay played the part with a gawky ,
c04-150-03 Northern defiance . The cameras played continuously on his
c04-150-04 craggy face , and obstinate , baffled eyes . They stripped
c04-150-05 him of his ugly battle-dress , to leave him for
c04-150-06 what he was - Potter , a frightened boy who had a
c04-150-07 vision .
c04-165-00 The film replaced " What 's My Line ? " and " Be My
c04-165-01 Guest " programmes because of an electricians'
c04-165-02 strike . It showed Britain today through the eyes
c04-165-03 of an American T V reporter , Eric Sevareid , and
c04-165-04 British personalities . Among them - Professor
c04-165-05 Dennis Brogan , Shelagh Delaney , and Alan Sillitoe .
c04-165-06 The film covered a wide aspect of the British
c04-165-07 scene , ranging from pubs , the Eton wall game ,
c04-165-08 to the European Common Market .
c04-170-00 Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked
c04-170-01 education . It was left to reporter Sevareid
c04-170-02 to make the strongest criticisms . He said
c04-170-03 that in the race of the modern nations ,
c04-170-04 Britain was slipping behind ... .
c06-011-00 ALSO present is a London journalist who
c06-011-01 arrived two hours earlier by appointment
c06-011-02 to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
c06-011-03 The Hostage about his new work , if any ,
c06-011-04 and who is now being pluckily convivial
c06-011-05 to fight off the frustration . The telephone
c06-011-06 has rung a couple of times , calls from
c06-011-07 other chums sniffing the wind and
c06-011-08 offering to drop by for a chat .
d01-016-00 The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
d01-016-01 the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
d01-016-02 plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote .
d01-016-03 The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
d01-019-00 There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
d01-019-01 Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The
d01-019-02 present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The
d01-019-03 original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was
d01-019-04 accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he
d01-019-05 could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order .
d01-049-00 The one real weakness of the Commentator's
d01-049-01 case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,
d01-049-02 he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly
d01-049-03 how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01-049-04 been able to explain the textual movements by
d01-049-05 showing that such changes are part of a
d01-049-06 simple and coherent plan . To understand how
d01-049-07 this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01-049-08 text of the Gospel .
d01-052-00 THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01-052-01 written in Greek . A modern text of the
d01-052-02 Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01-052-03 scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01-052-04 scripts of John and worked out the version
d01-052-05 which is most likely to have been the original
d01-052-06 wording . It is not possible to establish any one
d01-052-07 text with absolute precision .
d01-080-00 The bar was the commonest marking , but others
d01-080-01 were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01-080-02 bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as
d01-080-03 it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
d01-080-04 paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
d01-080-05 the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01-080-06 some markings would be used , although which , it is
d01-080-07 impossible to say .
d01-085-00 Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
d01-085-01 the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
d01-085-02 original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,
d01-085-03 whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in
d01-085-04 columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01-085-05 manuscripts . A common size of column would hold
d01-085-06 about one third of a page of Souter's print .
d01-098-00 The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-01 and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
d01-098-02 a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
d01-098-03 which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-04 this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
d01-098-05 was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not
d01-098-06 an easy form of book in which to find a
d01-098-07 reference .
d01-104-00 This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01 ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
d01-104-02 the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-03 As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04 overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
d01-104-05 information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-06 The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01-104-07 sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d01-104-08 they are in modern books .
d01-118-00 Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01-118-01 might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
d01-118-02 whether or not a particular text was written on
d01-118-03 a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
d01-118-04 writing , but any papyrus left unused at the
d01-118-05 end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
d01-118-06 the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on .
d01-123-00 The verso of the roll was blank , and one
d01-123-01 cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,
d01-123-02 sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,
d01-123-03 while one whole side of his roll was unused .
d01-123-04 The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
d01-123-05 in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra
d01-123-06 sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01-123-07 over the binding , or the whole codex rebound .
d03-117-00 A natural transition from gardens and
d03-117-01 orchards to the vital question of water
d03-117-02 supply . The pools are probably natural springs
d03-117-03 enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
d03-117-04 the rock . King Mesha of Moab boasts of their
d03-117-05 construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone ,
d03-117-06 which read : And I built Baal-meon and made
d03-117-07 in it the reservoir ... and I made both the
d03-117-08 reservoirs for water inside the town .
d04-012-00 The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-01 personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
d04-012-02 word " SHAMIR " means guarded or preser-
d04-012-03 ved . Therefore , the real man , who
d04-012-04 regards himself as insignificant , as the
d04-012-05 prayer says : " What am I ? A worm " , he
d04-012-06 is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-07 the Shmah , loves the Lord God with
d04-012-08 all his heart , and with all his soul and
d04-012-09 with all his might and studies the
d04-012-10 word of God .
d04-016-00 This man is the worm , the creature that
d04-016-01 cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such
d04-016-02 a man is the Shamir that guards him-
d04-016-03 self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
d04-016-04 Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
d04-016-05 to mould our character , to melt our
d04-016-06 heart of stone . This Shamir helps
d04-016-07 us earthly creatures to build an Altar
d04-016-08 for God to come nearer to God .
d04-021-00 The action of the Shamir writes books and their
d04-021-01 books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare
d04-021-02 diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest
d04-021-03 facts . And these creatures existed from the
d04-021-04 beginning . It is " the stone , which the builders
d04-021-05 refused , but it is to become the head-stone
d04-021-06 of the corner " . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall
d04-021-07 tell !
d04-028-00 " For the stone shall cry out of the wall " , like
d04-028-01 Baalam's ass , " and the purlin of timber shall
d04-028-02 creak in answer " " if the roof of our security is
d04-028-03 crushing our soul " ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) . And it is
d04-028-04 through the Shamir : " That the earth shall be
d04-028-05 filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
d04-028-06 Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " ( Hab. 2 , 14 . )
d04-032-00 The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue ,
d04-032-01 which is written on two plates , the hard facts
d04-032-02 of life , and all facts are " one " . We have all
d04-032-03 come across human Shamirs and they leave
d04-032-04 a deep impression on our feelings and senses .
d04-032-05 They make us the Altar for God to emit
d04-032-06 the Light which can be read in every
d04-032-07 language . The Shamir is the " seventh " and
d04-032-08 most important creature , that was created on
d04-032-09 the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the
d04-032-10 Sabbath , real peace to the whole world .
d04-037-00 Then the whole earth will be His Altar . " And it
d04-037-01 shall come to pass , if 1ye shall 1hearken
d04-037-02 diligently unto my commandments , which I command
d04-037-03 you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to
d04-037-04 serve Him with all your heart and with all
d04-037-05 your soul . " This may seem very good , but there
d04-037-06 is something deficient .
d04-047-00 Under such conditions without putting your
d04-047-01 mind together we cannot solve the further
d04-047-02 summons of destiny , to solve the economic
d04-047-03 problems . Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
d04-047-04 Jochai ( Tanis 6a ) " if Israel does not fulfil
d04-047-05 the wish of the Lord , failing to serve the
d04-047-06 Lord God with all their visionary power ,
d04-047-07 the work will have to be done by each
d04-047-08 individual " .
d04-050-00 They will not work in union . If physical power , spiritual power
d04-050-01 and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart
d04-050-02 selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
d04-050-03 gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in
d04-050-04 for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your
d04-050-05 corn , your wine and your oil .
d04-053-00 Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
d04-053-01 freedom from fear , fear of starvation in the
d04-053-02 midst of plenty . Help will not be easily forth-
d04-053-03 coming for the people in need . They will
d04-053-04 think of the animals first ( which is of course
d04-053-05 our duty ) . Of course the individual will
d04-053-06 eat and be full but : " Take heed to yourself ,
d04-053-07 that your heart be not deceived , and 1ye turn
d04-053-08 aside , and serve other gods , and worship them " ,
d04-053-09 the yourself is thy greatest enemy , the self-
d04-053-10 seeking self .
d04-058-00 And you serve Mammon and God . And you cannot serve
d04-058-01 two masters , and you worship self-interest , isolating
d04-058-02 yourself , under such conditions the goods are your gods .
d04-058-03 " And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you , and he
d04-058-04 shut up the heavens , that there is no rain , and that the land
d04-058-05 yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the
d04-058-06 good land which the Lord 1giveth you . "
d04-062-00 For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all
d04-062-01 your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
d04-062-02 the problem of life cannot be solved . " Therefore shall 1ye lay
d04-062-03 up these my words in your heart and in your soul . " The text
d04-062-04 adds and in your soul , searching your soul .
d04-066-00 And the sequence in the text is different than
d04-066-01 in the first part of the Shmah , we have first " and
d04-066-02 to bind them for a sign upon your hand , that
d04-066-03 they may be as frontlets between your eyes . " First to
d04-066-04 bind them to have the vision and then " And 1ye
d04-066-05 shall teach them to your children . " And as we have go-
d04-066-06 ne through the mill , we need not teach them
d04-066-07 to the children any more diligently and the
d04-066-08 children will grasp now what will befall
d04-066-09 them without visionary power .
d04-086-00 And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
d04-086-01 just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
d04-086-02 are used on Passover , to depict the " time of our freedom " .
d04-086-03 And they are ( 1 ) Matzo ; ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs ; ( 3 ) Salt-water and
d04-086-04 Charauses ( a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
d04-086-05 appearance of mortar ) ; and ( 4 ) an attitude to lean
d04-086-06 back .
d04-089-00 ( 1 ) Matzos is deficient bread , ( LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew ) ,
d04-089-01 so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge , and to
d04-089-02 cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
d04-089-03 to learn . Education is always the most important task .
d04-089-04 Education gives : Freedom of Speech . ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs
d04-089-05 symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us .
d04-089-06 We eat it . We accept it , to show we have self-control
d04-089-07 and that God dwells within us .
d04-096-00 Self-control gives us : Freedom to worship God . ( 3 ) Salt Water and Charauses :
d04-096-01 the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
d04-096-02 ( MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew , Salt is the covenant of 1thy God ,
d04-096-03 Levit. 2 , 13 . ) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
d04-096-04 ourselves and have peace with one-another . And the sweet
d04-096-05 Mortar ( the CHARAUSES in Hebrew ) that binds all the " hard-
d04-096-06 facts " together and explains them , represents the Oral
d04-096-07 Tradition .
d04-101-00 We dip into both , at the Seder . And we want to understand
d04-101-01 more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition , our inheritance .
d04-101-02 Living the life of the Torah ( " dipping-in " ) makes us
d04-101-03 meek : " But the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall
d04-101-04 delight themselves in the abundance of Peace " ( Psalm 37 ,
d04-101-05 11 ) . That gives us freedom from want .
d04-111-00 ( 1 ) Matzo represents Peshat ; ( 2 ) Moraur
d04-111-01 represents Remez ; ( 3 ) Dipping-in represents
d04-111-02 Derush ; ( 4 ) Leaning-back represents Saud .
d04-111-03 ( This is the PARDUS . ) Matzo represents
d04-111-04 the literal meaning of Pesach which
d04-111-05 is called : The Feast of Matzos . The
d04-111-06 Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
d04-111-07 principle and this gives us " a wink " ( Remez )
d04-111-08 how to live and accept all the bitterness
d04-111-09 that is hurled against us . The Salt-water
d04-111-10 and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
d04-111-11 the richness of the Law and that we should
d04-125-00 And we answer , that the Lord our God gave us " four freedoms "
d04-125-01 without which Society cannot make progress . And we drink
d04-125-02 " four cups " to thank the Lord our God for the " four
d04-125-03 freedoms " which are Divine . There are four ways of
d04-125-04 redemption : ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-125-05 burdens of Egypt . ( 2 ) I will rid you of their bondage .
d04-131-00 ( 3 ) I will redeem you . ( 4 ) I will take you to me for a
d04-131-01 people . ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-131-02 burdens of Egypt : How was it that Israel was
d04-131-03 brought out from under the burdens of Egypt ?
d04-131-04 Because , they kept the Passover and they were
d04-131-05 eating Matzos in Egypt and the " Feast of Matzos "
d04-131-06 was known even to Abraham and Lot .
d05-008-00 The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-01 the throne . He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-02 tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-03 spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for
d05-008-04 James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,
d05-008-05 but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer
d05-008-06 Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-07 derived little comfort from it .
d05-013-00 They objected to the word Absolution . So the phrase ' or
d05-013-01 the remission of sins ' was added . But Absolution remained .
d05-013-02 They objected to the word Confirmation . So the phrase
d05-013-03 ' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
d05-013-04 able to render an account of their faith according
d05-013-05 to the Catechism following ' were added . But Confirmation
d05-013-06 remained . Other changes in the Book were equally
d05-013-07 minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
d05-013-08 added to the Catechism .
d05-021-00 This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
d05-021-01 been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for
d05-021-02 it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are
d05-021-03 verily and indeed taken and received by the
d05-021-04 faithful in the Lord's Supper . ' It could hardly be more
d05-021-05 definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made
d05-021-06 himself immortal by becoming associated with
d05-021-07 a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05-021-08 ( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
d05-025-00 In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05-025-01 forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05-025-02 before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05-025-03 just learning to read . James was followed by
d05-025-04 Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish
d05-025-05 Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
d05-025-06 a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05-025-07 became the foster mother of some of the most
d05-025-08 important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05-025-09 Communion .
d05-030-00 Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,
d05-030-01 now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-02 led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-03 by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was
d05-030-04 mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
d05-030-05 first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-06 the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly
d05-030-07 with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,
d05-030-08 was necessarily a menace .
d05-040-00 Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ?
d05-040-01 Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase
d05-040-02 a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected
d05-040-03 and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be
d05-040-04 altars and not any broken down , transportable
d05-040-05 table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
d06-003-00 Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child
d06-003-01 by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know
d06-003-02 that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,
d06-003-03 but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting
d06-003-04 that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
d06-003-05 to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the
d06-003-06 other side as victors .
d06-008-00 To ridicule them only pushes them farther
d06-008-01 into themselves , so that they become
d06-008-02 unable to speak about it to anybody and
d06-008-03 the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,
d06-008-04 the harvest of which may still be being
d06-008-05 reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to
d06-008-06 agree with a child that a particular
d06-008-07 situation is frightening , and then to face
d06-008-08 it together until the child can see how
d06-008-09 unnecessary its fears were .
d06-011-00 Because situations which may contain
d06-011-01 all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,
d06-011-02 it is a good idea to condition a child
d06-011-03 to some extent against it . To keep a child
d06-011-04 of twelve or thirteen under the
d06-011-05 impression that nothing nasty ever
d06-011-06 happens is not merely dishonest , it
d06-011-07 is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
d06-011-08 later chapter there are some situations
d06-011-09 which occur less frequently than
d06-020-00 In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
d06-020-01 should pass from Him . Jesus shows us
d06-020-02 the way to face life . To see all the latent
d06-020-03 frightening possibilities and yet by facing
d06-020-04 them and knowing God is with us and
d06-020-05 that , with Him , there is nothing that can
d06-020-06 finally defeat us . More than that , that God
d06-020-07 has something important to do with our
d06-020-08 lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,
d06-020-09 the stronger we become .
d06-025-00 ... Today A wonderful thought In the
d06-025-01 dawn was given ... And the thought
d06-025-02 Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
d06-025-03 my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,
d06-025-04 Because of the plan That God , Who
d06-025-05 dwells in my hand , Knows this
d06-025-06 secret plan , Of the things He will
d06-025-07 do for the world Using my hand .
d06-027-00 Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced
d06-027-01 all human emotion , and whose sensitive
d06-027-02 nature knows better than we do , what it is to
d06-027-03 be really afraid , help us to know that when
d06-027-04 we face life boldly , many of the shadows are
d06-027-05 seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,
d06-027-06 come what may , we are never alone when
d06-027-07 we are with Thee .
d06-037-00 To others , the long hours of the night bring
d06-037-01 only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06-037-02 which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06-037-03 than when they went to bed . We may begin
d06-037-04 to understand this a little better when we
d06-037-05 realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06-037-06 the mind . Very few people , under normal
d06-037-07 conditions , work themselves to a standstill .
d06-041-00 The mind tires first and conveys the impression
d06-041-01 of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by
d06-041-02 noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
d06-041-03 body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose
d06-041-04 a mother has news late at night that her
d06-041-05 child is in danger . She will undertake a
d06-041-06 journey which , an hour before , she would
d06-041-07 have declared impossible .
d06-046-00 Even more simply , test your own reactions
d06-046-01 to different situations . There are some which
d06-046-02 bring on an almost immediate feeling of
d06-046-03 tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
d06-046-04 the washing-up - while others , if they
d06-046-05 refer to something you like doing , bring a
d06-046-06 veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who
d06-046-07 is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
d06-046-08 up with no apparent tiredness at all when
d06-046-09 her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
d06-056-00 They drag themselves around and can become
d06-056-01 a burden to their families and their friends .
d06-056-02 Any mental confusion can cause this and
d06-056-03 the best way is probably to seek advice .
d06-056-04 As we are unable to cure our own bodies
d06-056-05 if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,
d06-056-06 so we are unable to cure our own minds ,
d06-056-07 if the trouble is a complicated one
d06-056-08 involving careful and patient treatment .
d06-060-00 One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06-060-01 made this century is the way in which illness
d06-060-02 of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,
d06-060-03 and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06-060-04 physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a
d06-060-05 great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06-060-06 no major complication but results from an
d06-060-07 inability to deal with life , especially under
d06-060-08 the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
d06-060-09 century .
d06-063-00 In the days when most people were born ,
d06-063-01 lived and died within the boundaries of
d06-063-02 the village , it was not difficult for anybody
d06-063-03 to live a day at a time . Even those who
d06-063-04 held a high and responsible office lived in
d06-063-05 far greater simplicity than their successors .
d06-063-06 When news from the Continent took days ,
d06-063-07 from America weeks , from the Far East ,
d06-063-08 months , even a Prime Minister could go to
d06-063-09 sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
d06-063-10 be happening at the other end of England ,
d06-067-00 In other ways , too , life for the ordinary
d06-067-01 individual has become so complex
d06-067-02 that it taxes the mind . Two hundred
d06-067-03 years ago , men lived and worked
d06-067-04 in one place , their lives were of one
d06-067-05 piece . Now a man may live twenty ,
d06-067-06 thirty even sixty miles from his
d06-067-07 work . The only connexion is the
d06-067-08 pipeline of the railway on which they
d06-067-09 travel day by day .
d06-072-00 In many cases , their homes know little of
d06-072-01 their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-02 the office or works wonder what they
d06-072-03 are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-04 homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead
d06-072-05 a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-06 planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-07 of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
d06-072-08 compartments but over the years it builds up ,
d06-072-09 and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-072-10 need to be handled correctly .
d06-076-00 Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
d06-076-01 as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-
d06-076-02 necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness .
d06-076-03 We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time
d06-076-04 after time we forget something and have to go back
d06-076-05 upstairs or down to the shops .
d06-086-00 The housewife would find life far less tiring
d06-086-01 if she made a list , followed a routine of work
d06-086-02 rather than getting from one thing to the next .
d06-086-03 The business man would find that he reached
d06-086-04 the end of the day with far less strain if
d06-086-05 he was a little more systematic . To drift
d06-086-06 aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
d06-086-07 thing else . If we would only sit down and
d06-086-08 write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
d06-086-09 be done and then work quietly through them ,
d06-086-10 we would find life considerably less exhausting
d06-096-00 I am more than conscious of this . How anybody
d06-096-01 can go through the same routine day in and day
d06-096-02 out for forty years I find difficult to understand .
d06-096-03 A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
d06-096-04 commerce may be kept going - though if ever
d06-096-05 it becomes possible to work out a system
d06-096-06 of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense
d06-096-07 amount of good over and above relieving
d06-096-08 the pressure on over-crowded trains .
d06-100-00 As it is , with so much of our life already
d06-100-01 in a predetermined groove , I would
d06-100-02 hardly like to add further to the dullness
d06-100-03 which it engenders . But I am not arguing
d06-100-04 for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
d06-100-05 and I was interested some little while
d06-100-06 ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
d06-100-07 day timetable .
d06-104-00 They only worked , of course , a five-
d06-104-01 day week so that in the first week
d06-104-02 Monday to Friday were days one
d06-104-03 to five of the timetable , the following
d06-104-04 Monday was day six and Tuesday
d06-104-05 started day one again and so on .
d06-104-06 By this means they avoided each
d06-104-07 week being the same with a pupil
d06-104-08 knowing exactly what the subject
d06-104-09 would be on Friday afternoon at
d06-104-10 3 p.m. .
d06-107-00 It was a little complicated to work ,
d06-107-01 of course , and there had to be a big
d06-107-02 notice in the entrance saying which
d06-107-03 day of the timetable it was - but
d06-107-04 it added immensely to the interest
d06-107-05 and kept everybody on their toes .
d06-107-06 To have order does not mean getting
d06-107-07 into a dull routine . I have great
d06-107-08 sympathy with the young wife
d06-107-09 who does not always want to do
d06-107-10 the washing on a Monday .
d06-111-00 I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through
d06-111-01 the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to
d06-111-02 sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
d06-111-03 do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be
d06-111-04 done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors
d06-111-05 - you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of
d06-111-06 the early closing day ) .
d06-113-00 She will , in fact , be surprised at what peace
d06-113-01 of mind ensues . ( b ) Concentrate on one
d06-113-02 thing at a time . A list or a plan enables us to
d06-113-03 put all our energies into the particular
d06-113-04 matter on hand .
d07-082-00 ( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof
d07-082-01 texts and the Gemara explains why these ,
d07-082-02 too , are necessary , but a careful examination
d07-082-03 of that passage makes it clear that these are
d07-082-04 not quoted here because they are not
d07-082-05 necessary to prove the point made by
d07-082-06 R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that
d07-082-07 the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
d07-082-08 elsewhere .
d07-085-00 From the above it follows that here , once again ,
d07-085-01 we have a good illustration of how a
d07-085-02 sugya has been fashioned from material
d07-085-03 already in the hands of the Redactors .
d07-085-04 The sugya is built around the saying of
d07-085-05 R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
d07-085-06 reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07-085-07 with the comment given by Samuel .
d07-089-00 ( This is probably to be understood as a well-
d07-089-01 known comment on the verse ; quoted by
d07-089-02 Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-03 by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
d07-089-04 Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by
d07-089-05 the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
d07-089-06 There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07-089-07 because the Mishnah deals with the
d07-089-08 actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07-089-09 Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07-089-10 texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07-093-00 The question and answer with regard to the
d07-093-01 need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07-093-02 here in the same words in which they are
d07-093-03 quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
d07-093-04 This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07-093-05 quoting a well-known question and
d07-093-06 answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07-093-07 the longer sugya which deals with all
d07-093-08 four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
d07-096-00 Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07-096-01 original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-02 in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
d07-096-03 use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
d07-096-04 accord but there was no approval of his action
d07-096-05 in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an
d07-096-06 expression appears to have been framed in
d07-096-07 response to the particular point at issue here ,
d07-096-08 whether the Heavenly Court concurred
d07-096-09 in the decision of the human court . )
d07-100-00 The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
d07-100-01 is then quoted and the interpretation of the
d07-100-02 latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
d07-100-03 is added , not because this is at all relevant
d07-100-04 to the discussion but because it was
d07-100-05 a familiar interpretation which had
d07-100-06 become so well known that it was
d07-100-07 invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07-100-08 itself was quoted , almost as if it were a
d07-100-09 part of the verse .
d07-102-00 The Gemara continues with a saying of the
d07-102-01 Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :
d07-102-02 ' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
d07-102-03 the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,
d07-102-04 and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
d07-102-05 saying here is obvious , it follows naturally
d07-102-06 on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07-102-07 deals with a similar theme .
e01-055-00 One can remember with horror the pictures of the
e01-055-01 overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
e01-055-02 complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-
e01-055-03 piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
e01-055-04 numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years
e01-055-05 after the Victorian period that designers realised
e01-055-06 the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was
e01-055-07 revived with designs suitable for contemporary
e01-055-08 trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and
e01-055-09 has even stepped into the field of high fashion .
e06-000-00 This could hardly happen without the
e06-000-01 herring having some orientation with the
e06-000-02 sea bottom . It means that the crowding
e06-000-03 is caused during the daytime , and that
e06-000-04 the herring must continue to migrate over
e06-000-05 the ground as well as in midwater and
e06-000-06 during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
e06-000-07 is always from the north ) .
e06-003-00 Thus we can see that herring
e06-003-01 movements , although primarily
e06-003-02 instinctive perhaps , and certainly
e06-003-03 helped and hindered by water flow ,
e06-003-04 are also closely related to the sea-bed
e06-003-05 geography . Geography , too , names the
e06-003-06 great fisheries that depend on them :
e06-003-07 the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
e06-003-08 shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,
e06-003-09 a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
e06-003-10 the herring spawn along the northern
e06-010-00 In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
e06-010-01 Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But
e06-010-02 they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until
e06-010-03 in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
e06-010-04 echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
e06-010-05 their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
e06-010-06 gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
e06-010-07 spawning herring are always found .
e06-015-00 The joint evidence of echo-sounders
e06-015-01 and fishing gear leads to an overall
e06-015-02 though somewhat dim picture .
e06-015-03 The details are harder still to see .
e06-015-04 Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance ,
e06-015-05 shoals that gather at the Knoll or
e06-015-06 other banks are most of them
e06-015-07 going to travel a hundred
e06-015-08 miles farther south before they
e06-015-09 spawn . Some will spawn at the
e06-021-00 So the arrival of any particular shoal
e06-021-01 fish at a certain spawning ground may
e06-021-02 be accidental . Yet there will always be some
e06-021-03 that find it if enough are travelling , just as
e06-021-04 the robin who gets back exactly may be
e06-021-05 only one among thousands who do not .
e06-021-06 But this southerly migration is not
e06-021-07 accidental . Being contranatant or against
e06-021-08 the drift , it probably has a survival value
e06-021-09 in ensuring that the fry after hatching
e06-021-10 are drifted back into the normal home
e06-026-00 Drift in another form probably
e06-026-01 explains how these migrating herring
e06-026-02 are biased to east or west by the
e06-026-03 different winds . Strong westerlies
e06-026-04 are well known to bring good
e06-026-05 longshore fishings . The surface
e06-026-06 water that is blown offshore must
e06-026-07 be replaced by an underflow bringing
e06-026-08 with it the herring to the Norfolk
e06-026-09 and Suffolk beaches .
e06-030-00 Easterly winds , on the other hand ,
e06-030-01 mean no herring along the shore , as
e06-030-02 recent years have shown . A succession
e06-030-03 of winds is needed for this effect of
e06-030-04 course - one breeze will not do it ,
e06-030-05 though a very hard westerly will
e06-030-06 often start off the " local " herring ;
e06-030-07 but quite apart from this wind effect
e06-030-08 there is an easterly drift special
e06-030-09 to this rump of coastline , caused by
e06-030-10 the meeting of water from north and south .
e06-033-00 Herring fishermen call this " the outset " . It
e06-033-01 is strongest at spring tides , when without
e06-033-02 wind you will " set " out - or drift to the east-
e06-033-03 ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -
e06-033-04 almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
e06-033-05 Knoll . Without an explanation of how it
e06-033-06 works , it may well be that this outset , akin
e06-033-07 to the mouth of a great salmon river , has
e06-033-08 been the biggest factor through the ages
e06-033-09 in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
e06-046-00 ( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
e06-046-01 be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed
e06-046-02 sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations
e06-046-03 through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow
e06-046-04 wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something
e06-046-05 to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught .
e06-049-00 Let us consider first what would
e06-049-01 appear to be the simplest case -
e06-049-02 that of flat fish on the bottom .
e06-049-03 The evidence suggest that the fish are
e06-049-04 aware of the moving footrope before
e06-049-05 it reaches them . They move away before
e06-049-06 it , swimming at the same speed
e06-049-07 for an unknown period of time , until
e06-049-08 they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used
e06-049-09 to the disturbance .
e06-053-00 Then they stop swimming and are caught . In
e06-053-01 the seine-net film this usually seemed to
e06-053-02 happen just after the fish had risen above
e06-053-03 the footrope , and presumably out of its
e06-053-04 field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests
e06-053-05 that the wave might be transmitted by the
e06-053-06 sea-bed , though the footrope in this case
e06-053-07 was actually just off the bottom and was
e06-053-08 indeed passing over some fish .
e06-070-00 Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
e06-070-01 And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06-070-02 small , a matter of a foot or two . With round
e06-070-03 fish like haddock , which would hardly
e06-070-04 find safety on the bottom , this cover
e06-070-05 would seem to be even more essential ;
e06-070-06 but more films are needed to prove this .
e06-070-07 Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
e06-070-08 essential to catch round fish whose
e06-070-09 reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
f04-032-00 They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so-
f04-032-01 me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a
f04-032-02 man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
f04-032-03 the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from
f04-032-04 his hands . The inquest was opened on February 17 , but ,
f04-032-05 beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
f04-032-06 the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
f04-032-07 in which she had died , there was nothing on
f04-032-08 which to proceed , and the inquest was
f04-032-09 adjourned .
f04-035-00 Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
f04-035-01 trails . It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
f04-035-02 money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for
f04-035-03 a detailed account of his movements on the 11th . The dead
f04-035-04 woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
f04-035-05 named Brown .
f04-039-00 This man agreed that his engagement had
f04-039-01 been broken off after one particular
f04-039-02 tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
f04-039-03 money . All the while the police were casting about
f04-039-04 for a man who had been seen leaving the train
f04-039-05 at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
f04-039-06 as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with
f04-039-07 a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat
f04-039-08 and a top-hat .
f04-043-00 The porter at the station bore out this
f04-043-01 description , but the man was not traced .
f04-043-02 Perhaps the news of their search got around ,
f04-043-03 for a man did obligingly present himself
f04-043-04 at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have
f04-043-05 committed the murder - but he was mentally
f04-043-06 defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,
f04-043-07 had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
f04-053-00 And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with
f04-053-01 adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return
f04-053-02 a verdict of " wilful murder against some person or
f04-053-03 persons unknown . " The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
f04-053-04 pestle had been of no assistance . The killer must
f04-053-05 have been very thankful that the science of
f04-053-06 dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
f04-057-00 The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,
f04-057-01 yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
f04-057-02 a further seven years before even a ghost of a
f04-057-03 solution emerged . There has always been something
f04-057-04 sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of
f04-057-05 them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
f04-057-06 nected with railway construction ; and there
f04-057-07 were many people who believed that to travel
f04-057-08 through tunnels would be an equally
f04-057-09 hazardous business .
f04-061-00 Some thought that the result would be all
f04-061-01 sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
f04-061-02 confined atmosphere . " The shareholders who travel
f04-061-03 by it will be so heartily sick , what with the
f04-061-04 foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention
f04-061-05 of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha , "
f04-061-06 wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
f04-061-07 proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
f04-064-00 The mere thought of subterranean travel
f04-064-01 gave others a feeling of danger . A medical journal
f04-064-02 said , " the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden
f04-064-03 immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated
f04-064-04 sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
f04-064-05 momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill
f04-064-06 of annihilation . " It was also prophesied that
f04-064-07 passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
f04-064-08 darkness .
f04-068-00 For all that , as far as England is concerned ,
f04-068-01 there have been only two occasions on
f04-068-02 which a body has been found in a tunnel
f04-068-03 in circumstances pointing to murder .
f04-068-04 The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous
f04-068-05 Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy
f04-068-06 occurred on the same line , although this time the
f04-068-07 victim was a woman .
f04-071-00 Though in the minds of most people there was
f04-071-01 no doubt that the woman had been the victim
f04-071-02 of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there
f04-071-03 was not sufficient evidence to show whether
f04-071-04 she had fallen or been thrown from a train .
f04-071-05 The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to-
f04-071-06 Brighton line , is approximately one mile long ,
f04-071-07 and some time before midnight on September
f04-071-08 24 , 1905 , a Sunday , Sub-Inspector Peacock , of
f04-071-09 the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ,
f04-074-00 It was the battered and broken body of a woman .
f04-074-01 He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
f04-074-02 Station , and a stretcher party took the body to
f04-074-03 the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
f04-074-04 Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul
f04-074-05 had walked deliberately into the blackness and
f04-074-06 into the path of some train ? This hardly seemed
f04-074-07 likely , since , when she was examined by a local
f04-074-08 doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump ,
f04-074-09 was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
f04-074-10 almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends
f04-074-11 thrust in her mouth like a gag .
f04-079-00 Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,
f04-079-01 and there were other injuries on her body which had
f04-079-02 occurred before her death was ensured by some
f04-079-03 train which had roared through the tunnel . There were
f04-079-04 no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
f04-079-05 fication , no money , and no railway ticket . By then
f04-079-06 reports were being gathered about all traffic over
f04-079-07 this stretch of line , but no information was
f04-079-08 forthcoming about any carriage with an open
f04-079-09 door , nor any passenger reporting an incident
f04-079-10 which might relate .
f04-083-00 So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
f04-083-01 long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
f04-083-02 remained a mystery until later the following day .
f04-083-03 During that time a description of the girl was
f04-083-04 circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
f04-083-05 identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two .
f04-083-06 The girl , who was described as being " always bright and
f04-083-07 jolly , " had been unmarried , and lived at Lavender Hill ,
f04-083-08 Clapham , on the premises of a dairyman , Bridger , for
f04-083-09 whom she worked as a book-keeper .
f04-087-00 On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the
f04-087-01 evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma
f04-087-02 Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be
f04-087-03 gone for long . According to Miss Hone , she had not been
f04-087-04 carrying a handbag , but she believed she had had a small
f04-087-05 purse .
f07-000-00 SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000-01 told us that there was nothing an En-
f07-000-02 glishman would not do ; nothing an Ame-
f07-000-03 rican would not say ; nothing an
f07-000-04 Italian would not sing ; no music
f07-000-05 to which the Frenchman would not
f07-000-06 dance ; nothing the German would
f07-000-07 not covet ; and nothing the Chinese
f07-000-08 would not eat .
f07-000b-00 SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000b-01 told us that there was nothing an Englishman
f07-000b-02 would not do ; nothing an American would not
f07-000b-03 say ; nothing an Italian would not sing ; no
f07-000b-04 music to which the Frenchman would not dance ;
f07-000b-05 nothing the German would not covet ; and
f07-000b-06 nothing the Chinese would not eat .
f07-002-00 It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum .
f07-002-01 Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
f07-002-02 the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
f07-002-03 borrowed straight from the prehistoric . How
f07-002-04 many centuries ago , in some cave or hilly
f07-002-05 hide , did our forebears home from the chase
f07-002-06 hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
f07-002-07 meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
f07-002-08 homely and protecting flame .
f07-006-00 How many centuries later did the mercenary in
f07-006-01 the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
f07-006-02 evening meal . Later came the thrifty peasant ,
f07-006-03 later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
f07-006-04 in Paris , and even later our attractive young
f07-006-05 ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
f07-006-06 gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants .
f07-009-00 And , if certain dishes and modes of food have
f07-009-01 persisted down the ages , the motive that preserved
f07-009-02 them has always been the same . Apart from the need
f07-009-03 for nourishment , the instinct of hospitality has
f07-009-04 always been strong in mankind . The sharing of
f07-009-05 a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
f07-009-06 admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
f07-009-07 important than the casual meetings of the present
f07-009-08 day ; the desire to share something more intimate
f07-009-09 than mere converse has always been there .
f07-013-00 The truth is that good food offers a
f07-013-01 programme of entertainment almost
f07-013-02 unlimited in its variety and its presen-
f07-013-03 tation affords an opportunity of
f07-013-04 showing a guest something of ourselves .
f07-013-05 It is a far enough cry from the primitive
f07-013-06 meal-times of a simpler world to the
f07-013-07 banquets of later days , when the table
f07-013-08 groaned under its load of complicated
f07-013-09 dishes , and for all the blossoming of the
f07-013-10 arts around them the diners were little
f07-016-00 There was always the spice of an orgy
f07-016-01 in those Roman feasts , for instance , with
f07-016-02 all their peacocks and nightingales'
f07-016-03 tongues ; unreasonable surfeit , too , in the
f07-016-04 elaborate fashion of eating brought
f07-016-05 out of Italy into France , we are told ,
f07-016-06 by Catherine de Medici . The peasant in
f07-016-07 those days , as ever , ate sparingly , but
f07-016-08 generously enough in his own fashion ,
f07-016-09 save at feast times , when he , too , let
f07-016-10 himself go ; and it was from his simpler
f07-019a-00 Epicures and gourmands , sated by the unending
f07-019a-01 procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
f07-019a-02 of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
f07-019a-03 grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
f07-019a-04 the dishes of the country , and , instead of gorging the
f07-019a-05 eye with magnitude , began to understand the value of
f07-019a-06 intelligent selection and comparative simplicity , though
f07-019a-07 nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
f07-019a-08 monstrous .

f07-021a-00 Does one , however , know who first thought of boiling
f07-021a-01 water and food ? The ancient Britons , I believe , used to
f07-021a-02 make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it ,
f07-021a-03 because their pots would not stand fire ; but Jacob
f07-021a-04 must have had one that would , because Esau sold
f07-021a-05 his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
f07-021a-06 then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after
f07-021a-07 which the Israelites sighed .

f07-024a-00 Anyhow , Homer does not seem to have known any
f07-024a-01 way of cooking meat except by roasting and boiling .
f07-024a-02 When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish
f07-024a-03 was a grill , which he cooked himself , and he knew
f07-024a-04 how to do it , too : - When the languid flames at
f07-024a-05 length subside , He throws a bed of glowing
f07-024a-06 embers wide ; Above the coals the smoking
f07-024a-07 fragment turns , And sprinkles sacred salt from
f07-024a-08 lifted urns
f07-024b-00 Anyhow , Homer does not seem to have
f07-024b-01 known any way of cooking meat

f07-024b-03 Achilles gave a royal feast the principal

f07-024b-09 turns , And sprinkles sacred salt
f07-024b-10 from lifted urns .
f07-028a-00 When , however , the Greeks did learn the art of making
f07-028a-01 fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians , their cookery
f07-028a-02 made rapid progress , because they were men of taste
f07-028a-03 and intellect . A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
f07-028a-04 of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
f07-028a-05 confine the resources of the table to the gratification
f07-028a-06 of one sense alone . Having exhausted their invention
f07-028a-07 in the preparation of stimulants for the palate ,
f07-028a-08 they broke fresh ground and called another sense
f07-028a-09 to their aid .
f07-032a-00 By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
f07-032a-01 perfumes , these refined voluptuaries aroused the
f07-032a-02 fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
f07-032a-03 ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
f07-032a-04 board . The gratification of the sense of smelling
f07-032a-05 was a subject of no little importance to the Romans .
f07-032a-06 They considered flowers as forming a very essential
f07-032a-07 article in their festal preparations ; and it is the
f07-032a-08 opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
f07-032a-09 number of flowers far exceeded the number
f07-032a-10 of fruits .
f07-039a-00 According to Pliny , and others , certain herbs
f07-039a-01 and flowers proved of sovereign power
f07-039a-02 clarifying the functions of the brain . It
f07-039a-03 is said that there is nothing new under
f07-039a-04 the sun , but regarding foodstuffs the
f07-039a-05 traveller occasionally encounters a certain
f07-039a-06 measure of novelty .
f07-042a-00 In China , for instance , dried rats are esteemed
f07-042a-01 a delicacy . The visitor is told that
f07-042a-02 they restore the hair of the bald and that
f07-042a-03 a stewed black rat will ward off a fever .
f07-042a-04 A number of newly-born white mice served
f07-042a-05 alive , dipped in treacle and swallowed
f07-042a-06 like a prairie oyster is considered a
f07-042a-07 piece of resistance .
f07-046a-00 Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards
f07-046a-01 roasted on the point of a spear are
f07-046a-02 definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean
f07-046a-03 peoples have a high opinion of the octopus
f07-046a-04 as an article of diet . So have the Japanese
f07-046a-05 and the Chinese . The Celestials , apart
f07-046a-06 from eating it fresh , squash it , press
f07-046a-07 it and dry it , in which form , dusted
f07-046a-08 over with flour , you will find a stack
f07-046a-09 of it in almost any provision shop .
f07-069-00 Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament
f07-069-01 than is customarily imagined as well as entering human
f07-069-02 activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed .
f07-069-03 We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
f07-069-04 one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
f07-069-05 which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years .
f07-069-06 If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
f07-069-07 with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation ,
f07-069-08 Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
f07-069-09 provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
f07-073-00 The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
f07-073-01 Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with
f07-073-02 aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious
f07-073-03 fire , aerian creams , ingenious pastries and a
f07-073-04 crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to
f07-073-05 celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683 . Spanish
f07-073-06 cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights , of Spanish dancing
f07-073-07 and of Goja : it is vivid , highly coloured , sometimes
f07-073-08 Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour , with
f07-073-09 streaks of poetry , meat disguised under heavy and vehement
f07-076a-00 The Czechoslovak kitchen , again , is
f07-076a-01 so languorous , so passionate , and
f07-076a-02 possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
f07-076a-03 melody . The paprika and caraway perfume
f07-076a-04 the meats with their antithesis . The
f07-076a-05 opulent varieties of Czechoslovak past-
f07-076a-06 ries recall in fact the rich heritage
f07-076a-07 of rich embroideries and costumes
f07-076a-08 specifically national . The art and
f07-076a-09 science of cookery , however , is
f07-076a-10 essentially French , and , irrespective of
f07-081a-00 The French have an inborn appreciation
f07-081a-01 of good food and the gusto which they
f07-081a-02 derive from gastronomy is intellectual
f07-081a-03 and aesthetic as well as physical .
f07-081a-04 There is the same finesse about their
f07-081a-05 feeding , the same subtle delicacy of
f07-081a-06 touch , the same unfailing sense of
f07-081a-07 proportion as exists among her
f07-081a-08 writers , music composers and other
f07-081a-09 exponents of things that are
f07-081a-10 typically French .

f07-084a-00 The " pot-au-feu " is as much a national

f07-084a-03 least once a week in every bourgeois
f07-084a-04 household . Thackeray , of course ,
f07-084a-05 waxed enthusiastic about Bouilla-
f07-084a-06 baisse and sang - This Bouillabaisse
f07-084a-07 a noble dish is , A sort of soup , or
f07-084a-08 broth , or brew , A hotch-potch of all
f07-084a-09 sorts of fishes That Greenwich never
f07-084a-10 could outdo ; Green herbs , red peppers ,

f07-088a-00 A fascinating study also opens up in
f07-088a-01 the dietary welcomed by men of genius
f07-088a-02 as well as the foods for which they have
f07-088a-03 had an aversion . Shelley , for example ,
f07-088a-04 had a great contempt for animal
f07-088a-05 food , believing that it impaired the
f07-088a-06 intellectual faculties . Bunyan's break-
f07-088a-07 fast and supper consisted of a
f07-088a-08 piece of coarse bread and a
f07-088a-09 bowl of milk .

f07-092a-00 Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes
f07-092a-01 in food . At one dinner he is said to have
f07-092a-02 been blind to the charms of turbot and
f07-092a-03 to have been much more interested
f07-092a-04 in the dish in which it was served . He
f07-092a-05 turned it over on the table cloth to
f07-092a-06 examine the marks on the back
f07-092a-07 without going through the formality
f07-092a-08 of having his turbot removed first .

f07-092b-04 on the table cloth to examine the marks on the back
f07-092b-05 without going through the formality of having his turbot
f07-092b-06 removed first .
f07-096-00 Wagner was a highly practical feeder . He ate very fast ,
f07-096-01 placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as
f07-096-02 he talked . Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe
f07-096-03 which he washed down with beer . A writer who had dinner
f07-096-04 with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters , a brown
f07-096-05 sole , a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a
f07-096-06 gin punch .
f07-101b-00 The same man went to see Carlyle , and , after mentioning
f07-101b-01 that he had dined with Longfellow told the sage a
f07-101b-02 very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh ;
f07-101b-03 but all the Chelsea philosopher did in return was to
f07-101b-04 ask if his guest would have a cup of tea !
g01-004-00 It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
g01-004-01 Londoners , but it brought heavy censure from nobles
g01-004-02 who still believed that they had a monopoly of
g01-004-03 leadership . But , at last , Gaunt sailed . Opposing
g01-004-04 him was the French Admiral , Jean de Vienne -
g01-004-05 a great sailor and an able strategist .
g01-008-00 Obedient to the policy of his King , de Vienne avoided
g01-008-01 trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
g01-008-02 on land . Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
g01-008-03 an elusive foe , and , afraid to return home without
g01-008-04 something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege
g01-008-05 the well-protected fortress of St Malo . This
g01-008-06 involved the dreary method of mining operations in
g01-008-07 which Gaunt , under the Black Prince , had shown
g01-008-08 considerable skill at the siege of Limoges .
g01-012-00 When all seemed to be going well , a sortie surprised
g01-012-01 moment had charge of the mine ; the mine collapsed
g01-012-02 fame and glory . Gaunt was compelled to return
g01-012-03 even despised failure . The ' ribald ' Londoners , who
g01-012-04 Hawley , were also expressing their disappointment
g01-012-05 comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
g01-012-06 citizen .
g01-016-00 These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
g01-016-01 obvious morals for those who are judges long
g01-016-02 after the event . It seems obvious that , though
g01-016-03 the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
g01-016-04 plate and mail of French knights , a brilliant
g01-016-05 battle was no substitute for a sound policy ,
g01-016-06 and that , if archers had no target , campaigns
g01-016-07 became mere marauding route marches .
g01-019-00 It seems obvious that if an expedition to
g01-019-01 Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais ,
g01-019-02 then the primary essential to the success
g01-019-03 of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
g01-019-04 command of the Channel . It seems obvious
g01-019-05 that divided forces were dissipating the
g01-019-06 advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
g01-019-07 Calais , Cherbourg , Brest , Bordeaux and Bayonne ,
g01-019-08 and that there was no hope of final victory
g01-019-09 without a large-scale and concentrated invasion .
g01-025-00 In this cruel process which was
g01-025-01 hammering out nations on the anvils of
g01-025-02 war , there was a constant stirring of
g01-025-03 those in authority to find some simple
g01-025-04 way out of the complicated financial
g01-025-05 6impasse which always resulted , and in the
g01-025-06 story of the experiments and expedients
g01-025-07 to which the Exchequer resorted is
g01-025-08 the story of the prelude to the
g01-025-09 Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
g01-027-00 In appreciating this story , modern con-
g01-027-01 ceptions of governmental duties must be
g01-027-02 set aside . A modern government needs
g01-027-03 taxation not merely for defence and
g01-027-04 offence but for a very wide range of
g01-027-05 social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
g01-027-06 needed taxation in order to supplement
g01-027-07 the private wealth of the monarchy
g01-027-08 ( the royal income from the revenues of
g01-027-09 crown lands , the fees of feudalism
g01-031-00 Social service as a function of government
g01-031-01 was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
g01-031-02 substitute was the mutual self-help of
g01-031-03 communities , whether those communities were
g01-031-04 monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and
g01-031-05 guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was
g01-031-06 therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01-031-07 return was the uncertain bounty of booty
g01-031-08 and the vague advantages of military glory ;
g01-031-09 it was therefore always granted grudgingly
g01-031-10 and coupled with the vain hope that , in the
g01-034-00 When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
g01-034-01 booty , a new group of Lords might oust
g01-034-02 the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,
g01-034-03 who usually supplied the hard cash , might
g01-034-04 be bold enough to demand the production of
g01-034-05 accounts , and even at times the impeachment of
g01-034-06 the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not
g01-034-07 the people , and even a full Parliament was
g01-034-08 not yet a true mirror of the nation .
g01-037-00 The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
g01-037-01 ' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
g01-037-02 feudal obligations of work or villeins who
g01-037-03 had bought their release , free labourers
g01-037-04 who worked for the highest bidders , free
g01-037-05 yeomen who had prospered enough to become
g01-037-06 successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,
g01-037-07 journeymen and small tradesmen of the
g01-037-08 towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms
g01-037-09 in the pay of landed Lords .
g01-039-00 None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or
g01-039-01 expected to pay direct taxes . During the four-
g01-039-02 teenth century , the traditional methods of
g01-039-03 financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .
g01-039-04 When the King and his Council required additio-
g01-039-05 nal funds , they were usually granted an
g01-039-06 export tax on the wool trade , collected by
g01-039-07 means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
g01-039-08 prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su-
g01-039-09 pervised and controlled , together with a
g01-043-00 There were two other sources of public revenue -
g01-043-01 first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead
g01-043-02 of the Commons and in its own Convocations
g01-043-03 granted equivalent contributions , and second ,
g01-043-04 the foreign merchants , with whom the King's
g01-043-05 officials had formerly made private bargains
g01-043-06 at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose
g01-043-07 payments were now authorized by parliamentary
g01-043-08 sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
g01-043-09 excess of the rate for native merchants .
g01-045-00 In addition to these revenues , the King had the
g01-045-01 financial benefits of his position at the head
g01-045-02 of the feudal system , as its chief landowner
g01-045-03 and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
g01-045-04 It was , therefore , a complicated and not very
g01-045-05 satisfactory financial system in which the
g01-045-06 borders between private and public purse were
g01-045-07 as ill-defined as the borders between private
g01-045-08 and national war , and in which the comparati-
g01-045-09 vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
g01-067-00 But this time there was a very interesting
g01-067-01 attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
g01-067-02 payments demanded . The definition of an
g01-067-03 adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,
g01-067-04 and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,
g01-067-05 the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
g01-067-06 of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,
g01-067-07 and between these two extremes a graduated
g01-067-08 scale of payments was fixed for the
g01-067-09 different classes of laymen and clerics .
g01-070-00 Again the resentment was widespread and
g01-070-01 the results disappointing - a tax estimated
g01-070-02 to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 .
g01-070-03 In the following year , 1380 , the last and
g01-070-04 most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
g01-070-05 by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
g01-070-06 There were dark reasons for a meeting so
g01-070-07 far away from the capital in a town with
g01-070-08 poor communications and not over supplied
g01-070-09 with hostelries and lodgings .
g01-074-00 London was again in turmoil ; but this time
g01-074-01 over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-
g01-074-02 chant from Genoa had been murdered , and
g01-074-03 John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of
g01-074-04 those charged with the crime . It is clear
g01-074-05 from the chronicles that this was a sordid
g01-074-06 quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
g01-074-07 The city merchants were jealous of foreign
g01-074-08 merchants who could tempt court and
g01-074-09 baronage with rarer luxuries than those
g01-088-00 Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
g01-088-01 arithmetic which argued that , as the first
g01-088-02 poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of
g01-088-03 three times the rate would produce 66,000 .
g01-088-04 The only concession made in view of the
g01-088-05 objections to the first two poll-taxes was
g01-088-06 the suggestion that the rich should help
g01-088-07 the poor - but this was only a pious hope
g01-088-08 because no machinery was provided for
g01-088-09 carrying it into effect , and a subordinate
g02-059-00 In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
g02-059-01 from the dissection of living animals , showing how these move-
g02-059-02 ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
g02-059-03 or in flagging warmer ones . At the time of its movement
g02-059-04 the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken ,
g02-059-05 its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
g02-059-06 content of blood , appearing paler in so doing in animals
g02-059-07 such as serpents , frogs , and the like .
g02-062-00 At one and the same time , therefore , occur the beat
g02-062-01 of the apex , the thickening of the heart walls , and
g02-062-02 the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
g02-062-03 contraction of the ventricles . Going on in Chapter Three
g02-062-04 to the movement of the arteries , likewise gauged from
g02-062-05 the dissections of living animals , Harvey noted that
g02-062-06 contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
g02-062-07 systole , simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
g02-062-08 and of the artery-like vein , and expulsion of the
g02-062-09 ventricular content .
g02-065-00 Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
g02-065-01 ventricular contraction . During cutting or puncture of
g02-065-02 the ventricles , there is often forcible expulsion
g02-065-03 of blood from the wound . Arterial diastole is
g02-065-04 thus synchronous with cardiac systole but ,
g02-065-05 when movement of blood through arteries is
g02-065-06 hindered by compression , infarction or inter-
g02-065-07 ception , the more distal arteries pulsate
g02-065-08 less because their pulse is nothing other
g02-065-09 than the impulse of the blood entering them .
g02-073-00 ' And while the heart is slowly dying ,
g02-073-01 one can sometimes see it - so to speak
g02-073-02 - rouse itself and , in reply to two or
g02-073-03 three auricular beats , produce a single
g02-073-04 ventricular one slowly and
g02-073-05 reluctantly and with an effort . '

g03-000-03 He was a socialist and believed in the right
g03-000-04 of the working class to control their own destiny , and
g03-000-05 said so . Being a craftsman and a skilled man ,
g03-000-06 George won many prizes , and though some people
g03-000-07 would have nothing to do with him , others
g03-000-08 would , and the comrades helped in many

g03-004-00 When eventually the ovens were fixed at the new shop , the tremen-
g03-004-01 dously hard work was if anything intensified . George used to
g03-004-02 mix 100 stone of bread in 12 hours , and Kate served in the

g03-032-00 Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings .
g03-032-01 One of the helpful by-products was that
g03-032-02 they were able to obtain some respectable
g03-032-03 clothing , with which they wore a white tie
g03-032-04 and Red Flag badge , thus presenting a much

g03-032-07 they would be there to begin the meeting .
g03-040-00 As they became known the Choir went to working-

g03-049-00 Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
g03-049-01 to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
g03-049-02 with them , particularly those who , like the Rev.
g03-049-03 Conrad Noel , the eloquent leader of
g03-049-04 the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated
g03-049-05 socialism . With such men , who had the

g03-052-00 There was no abatement in political

g04-022-00 After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit
g04-022-01 Germany for ten years , by which time in
g04-022-02 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
g04-022-03 Towards the end of my five and a half years'
g04-022-04 incumbency I was asked if I would start
g04-022-05 a village choral society and conduct it .
g04-022-06 This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
g04-022-07 into it .
g04-043-00 But what a change from the dear little old church
g04-043-01 at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
g04-043-02 at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the
g04-043-03 church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries
g04-043-04 had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
g04-043-05 chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is .
g04-043-06 When we had found a group of people who gladly
g04-043-07 co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place
g04-043-08 of daily prayer .
g04-048-00 I suggested to the congregation that it needed
g04-048-01 warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we
g04-048-02 found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
g04-048-03 stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
g04-048-04 helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
g04-048-05 for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
g04-048-06 gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West
g04-048-07 windows .
g04-052-00 It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
g04-052-01 such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
g04-052-02 a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
g04-052-03 the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible
g04-052-04 to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
g04-052-05 and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
g04-052-06 table to the environs .
g04-068-00 Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
g04-068-01 co-operation especially with the other Christian communities .
g04-068-02 At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
g04-068-03 ' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
g04-068-04 I found myself deeply involved . At first , the main work was to help
g04-068-05 wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
g04-068-06 allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased
g04-068-07 in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
g04-068-08 became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman
g04-068-09 of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
g04-072-00 Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at
g04-072-01 Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously
g04-072-02 Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee . This
g04-072-03 task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
g04-072-04 the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents ,
g04-072-05 and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries . Our
g04-072-06 Committee met once a week in the evenings , and
g04-072-07 included professional men from every walk of
g04-072-08 life .
g07-000b-00 When he saw Trelawny's printed letter , Lord Sidney wrote
g07-000b-01 to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
g07-000b-02 throughout . He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
g07-000b-03 and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
g07-000b-04 body to return to England than that course was
g07-000b-05 ' immediately carried into effect ' - not in spite of himself
g07-000b-06 and Sir Frederick Stoven , but with their perfect con-
g07-000b-07 currence , while ' General Adam was at Corfu the whole
g07-000b-08 time and # never interfered in the slightest
g07-000b-09 degree about the matter ' .
g07-079a-00 Their friendship for Augusta became rather
g07-079a-01 hollow , and the news that Byron had left
g07-079a-02 her practically all his money caused it to
g07-079a-03 crumble to oblivion . Though Lady Byron
g07-079a-04 knew perfectly well that Byron , as early
g07-079a-05 as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had
g07-079a-06 made a will in Augusta's favour , she had
g07-079a-07 evidently not passed on that information ;
g07-079a-08 and it came as an appalling surprise to
g07-079a-09 Captain Byron that he had been left
g07-079a-10 without the fortune that would keep up the
g07-079a-11 title .
m01-049-00 He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
m01-049-01 and came into the livingroom , where
m01-049-02 Heather and Steve stood aghast at
m01-049-03 his entrance . He came , almost falling
m01-049-04 forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck
m01-049-05 thrust out , arms dangling loosely .
m01-049-06 Then , abruptly , he drew himself up
m01-049-07 and walked on the very tips of
m01-049-08 his toes . He stretched his arms
m01-049-09 over his head and yawned agape ,
m01-049-10 drawing-in great breaths that
m01-049-11 became great sighs of ecstacy .
m01-060-00 " They have come ! " he said reverently , gripping his
m01-060-01 hands together between his knees and leaning
m01-060-02 forward . " Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited
m01-060-03 transcendent event , the exalted desire of all
m01-060-04 mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the
m01-060-05 Mind is at hand ! " He turned beaming eyes
m01-060-06 upward and shook his head slowly from
m01-060-07 side to side .
m01-079-00 A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
m01-079-01 abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait

m01-079-06 loses its beat in death .

m01-084-03 The set lighted-up but gave only a low
m01-084-04 buzzing sound . He had just finished
m01-084-05 shaving when it came on , with a flat
m01-084-06 voice repeating : " This is BBC calling
m01-084-07 ... this is BBC calling ... "
m01-095-00 Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01-095-01 Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A
m01-095-02 flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01-095-03 the War Memorial . There was a deep
m01-095-04 whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing
m01-095-05 overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01-095-06 almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
m01-095-07 turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
m01-104-00 " The Thetans , " he said , " are presumably here to
m01-104-01 take charge , as it were , of the minds of the
m01-104-02 people - who are probably falling all over them-
m01-104-03 selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
m01-104-04 them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't
m01-104-05 know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-
m01-104-06 caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
m01-104-07 longer have any immunity .
m01-110-00 There can be little doubt that if the
m01-110-01 Thetans discover our mental independence
m01-110-02 they will promptly give us their hypnotic
m01-110-03 treatment . If we can avoid undue
m01-110-04 prominence , it may be that we can
m01-110-05 move about pretty freely without
m01-110-06 detection . If we can - well , then we
m01-110-07 may be able to promote our own
m01-110-08 interests . What those interests
m01-110-09 are , beyond personal security ,
m01-110-10 I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,
m01-110-11 we may form the nucleus around ...
m01-121-00 There is just a hope that we may uncover
m01-121-01 some weakness , and find a way of fighting
m01-121-02 back at them . " Heather agreed , and suggested
m01-121-03 that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
m01-121-04 ting how the Thetan machinations had been
m01-121-05 working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
m01-121-06 not have been entirely an objective suggestion
m01-121-07 on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
m01-121-08 nevertheless .
m01-125-00 So they proceeded to see if the coast
m01-125-01 was clear . The street was quiet and
m01-125-02 deserted , and there were neither sight
m01-125-03 nor sound of flying saucers . So they
m01-125-04 ventured forth and made their way on
m01-125-05 foot to Dan's house . Dan came
m01-125-06 to the door at their ring but neglected
m01-125-07 to offer any greeting . He was deeply
m01-125-08 preoccupied , and it seemed that the
m01-125-09 ringing of a doorbell was to him
m01-125-10 a new and strange phenomenon .
m01-131-00 When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action
m01-131-01 gave the impression of having been thought out and
m01-131-02 decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while
m01-131-03 Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware
m01-131-04 of their presence . They just stared at him , turning
m01-131-05 their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
m01-131-06 down , up and down .
m01-136-00 His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01-136-01 impatience pending an awaited
m01-136-02 communication and of a vague
m01-136-03 perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01-136-04 and the purpose he was to serve .
m01-136-05 Finally , being so obviously on their own ,
m01-136-06 Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
m01-136-07 at home . Steve switched on Dan's
m01-136-08 powerful , world-wide radio and systematically
m01-136-09 turned the tuning knob through all the
m01-136-10 tuning points of the world's great radio
m01-149-00 They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where
m01-149-01 he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
m01-149-02 But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
m01-149-03 the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have
m01-149-04 been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies .
m01-149-05 First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone
m01-149-06 walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of
m01-149-07 a single all-exclusive purpose .
m02-048-00 Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
m02-048-01 real days and would return to New York in late
m02-048-02 January or early February . Angelina might be a
m02-048-03 little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
m02-048-04 as arranged , but he consoled himself by
m02-048-05 thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02-048-06 plenty of time together in the future . And
m02-048-07 Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be
m02-048-08 back on Moon again , and able to do
m02-048-09 research at first hand into matters on which
m02-048-10 the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ...
m02-055-00 They had been married for six years , but the
m02-055-01 salary raise , on the expectation of which they
m02-055-02 had done so , had not materialised . " Do you
m02-055-03 know , I had to send back our bedroom
m02-055-04 furniture in the second year , " she moaned . She
m02-055-05 had contacts in political circles , a school-
m02-055-06 friend of hers having married Lester Peron ,
m02-055-07 a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
m02-055-08 ( literally ) all-powerful Rocket Release
m02-055-09 Board .
m02-055-10 Hostettler
m02-059-00 Sometimes she took Harry around with her , but
m02-059-01 never her husband , a fact he accepted as inevitable . " I guess
m02-059-02 Sally made a mistake about me , " he said one
m02-059-03 evening , when he had been left to cook his own meal .
m02-059-04 All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now , but Tom
m02-059-05 was a Static Mib , the middle-income-bracket equivalent
m02-059-06 to 4sub-lil on the lower .
m02-066-00 All Aristotle was excited at the time , not by the prospect of the
m02-066-01 U.S. President's visit , but by a great storm in the photo-
m02-066-02 sphere of the sun . A matter which on Earth would hardly
m02-066-03 penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
m02-066-04 interest to the Mos , doubtless because their habitat is
m02-066-05 not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere .
m02-069-00 One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
m02-069-01 with time instil the reverence which , on Earth , nature inspires ,
m02-069-02 especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
m02-069-03 Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
m02-069-04 solar system . True enough , such ultimate weapons had not been
m02-069-05 used in the last few wars , but it seemed very probable
m02-069-06 that they would be in the next one , Moon and her
m02-069-07 allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
m02-069-08 weapons pronounced conventional .
m02-072-00 Lester was not home yet from his formidable
m02-072-01 duties and his wife , in the manner of middle-brow
m02-072-02 wives , romanced about him in his absence . " Lester was a
m02-072-03 country lawyer , and we were very small 4microdebs , weren't we ,

m02-080-01 That 's how he got the votes , that 's how
m02-080-02 we came through to 4makrodeb status and
m02-080-03 got all these lovely things " - she waved a
m02-080-04 plump hand towards her grand pianos , etc :

m02-080-06 say a word about it , Lester wants his

m02-080-08 has come for him to be taken seriously
m02-080-09 as a statesman . "
m02-087-00 But privately he turned out to be as friendly as
m02-087-01 Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer , to have the same adolescent
m02-087-02 openness and freshness , though perhaps not the same
m02-087-03 maturity . One remembered that he was a lawyer
m02-087-04 by training , and suspected that the points he made
m02-087-05 so sharply in international politics were as abstract
m02-087-06 to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
m02-087-07 of law .
m02-095-00 The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
m02-095-01 like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
m02-095-02 guise which , far from attracting the allegiance
m02-095-03 of free men everywhere , could only repel them .
m02-095-04 Then what of the cultural life ? Did this per-
m02-095-05 haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
m02-095-06 which might in time become social fact
m02-095-07 and counteract the obsession with economics
m02-095-08 which had grown up during the Moon's
m02-095-09 first two centuries ?
m02-109-00 Stepping out in their white shorts , they looked glad enough
m02-109-01 to be diverted , however , with the single exception of one
m02-109-02 worried little man-student who kept getting out of
m02-109-03 step . He looked as if nothing Moke and his
m02-109-04 minions could do to him would ever make him
m02-109-05 GO ; but the reason probably lay in elementary
m02-109-06 neurosis and not in some eruption from those
m02-109-07 deeper layers in the human psyche which are
m02-109-08 trans-economic .
m02-112-00 So once again the metaphysics were depressing ,
m02-112-01 and in absolute contrast to the physical display .
m02-112-02 Mos have an un-American love of parades , and
m02-112-03 these young ones , on parade for jobs which they
m02-112-04 had to get to pay off their college bills , were naturally
m02-112-05 putting their best foot forward .
m03-006-00 ' Something 's up , ' said Lord Undertone ,
m03-006-01 carefully casual . ' The servants are all on
m03-006-02 edge ... did you notice ? And the mules
m03-006-03 didn't seem to want to get off the raft . '
m03-006-04 He peered as it were into the dark secrets
m03-006-05 of the jungle . ' Think there 's Indians

m03-110-00 Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely
m03-110-01 Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
m03-110-02 myself ? But was it so ? I allowed myself
m03-110-03 to entertain for an instant the idea , the
m03-110-04 strange , the unwelcome , the almost
m03-110-05 inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival
m03-110-06 would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
m03-110-07 a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused ,
m03-110-08 to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs
m03-110-09 Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
m03-114-00 But all three were to the casual
m03-114-01 observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
m03-114-02 Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
m03-114-03 thoughtful , but that was his habit . Indeed
m03-114-04 we were all invaded by a most tranquil
m03-114-05 mood . Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,
m03-114-06 so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and
m03-114-07 savage tribes never approached this region : at
m03-114-08 any rate they remained with us , perhaps
m03-114-09 for such protection as our presence , or Mrs
m03-118-00 But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
m03-118-01 far from our minds that at any moment we were
m03-118-02 to receive a summons . I could see that Mr Septimus
m03-118-03 was impatient for it . This afternoon , then , we climbed
m03-118-04 a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with
m03-118-05 trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake .
m04-030-00 " Good-bye , Dai , " said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step .
m04-030-01 " Good-bye , Morfydd . " He sought to enfold her in his arms . But he was too late .
m04-030-02 She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away . And Morfydd Owen
m04-030-03 waving , unkissed , from the window . And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his
m04-030-04 heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
m04-038-00 So the bus set out for Llangrwl . But it never reached there ! Somewhere ,
m04-038-01 on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly
m04-038-02 scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a
m04-038-03 Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the
m04-038-04 Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
m04-038-05 damn bus .
m04-043-00 " Left here all right , " said Ifor . " Two-thirty-five , on the dot . " " It 's
m04-043-01 supposed to leave at two-twenty . " " Who says so ? " " Your timetable . "
m04-043-02 " Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables , " Ifor said ,
m04-043-03 reasonably . " Start running punctual and where are you ? People get
m04-043-04 left behind , isn't it ? Very exasperating for one and all . "
m04-061-00 " And what are you going to do about it ? " Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded .
m04-061-01 " What do you want me to do ? Send out a sheriff's posse , is it ? " No sense
m04-061-02 of humour , that Isaiah . He banged down the receiver . Very uncivil . Dropped
m04-061-03 the mask , now , Ifor did . " Dai Pugh , " he bellowed . " Leap on your bicycle
m04-061-04 and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy .
m04-072-00 The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
m04-072-01 complete her mission . " Paled , did Dai . For the
m04-072-02 two-twenty carried , for him , a cargo more
m04-072-03 precious than jewels . Though Mofydd Owen
m04-072-04 was , as he feared , departed out of his life ,
m04-072-05 he still loved her dearly . Already , even
m04-072-06 as with trembling fingers he fastened his
m04-072-07 trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in
m04-072-08 some dreadful ravine , or beset by
m04-072-09 robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency
m04-072-10 Ward 10 .
m04-078-00 But even his imagination , luckily for him ,
m04-078-01 did not visualise the awful truth - that
m04-078-02 Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
m04-078-03 the title of " First Woman to Enter Space . "
m04-078-04 " Where are we going , Mam ? " inquired little
m04-078-05 Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
m04-078-06 the fact that the green earth was falling
m04-078-07 away at a rate of knots .
m04-081-00 Where indeed ? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
m04-081-01 to the conductor , demanding an explanation .
m04-081-02 But nonplussed , the conductor was . A
m04-081-03 good man , mind ; knew his job . But out of
m04-081-04 depth in this particular instance . Fingered
m04-081-05 his ticket-punch nervously . Peered out of
m04-081-06 the window . Went and consulted the driver .
m04-081-07 " Where are we going ? " he echoed Cadwallader .
m04-081-08 " Damned if I know , boy , " said the driver .
m04-081-09 " But something very untoward has
m04-081-10 happened , if you ask me . "
m04-093-00 Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the
m04-093-01 Rev. Edwards . Now he put down his paper ,
m04-093-02 folded it , and glanced idly out of the
m04-093-03 window . Looked again , eyes starting from
m04-093-04 his head . " God bless my immortal soul , "
m04-093-05 he cried . " Never mind your immortal
m04-093-06 soul , " said Megan Thomas tartly .
m04-093-07 " Here we are traversing the heavens at the
m04-093-08 very moment when we should be
m04-093-09 running into Llangrwl bus station .
m04-100-00 And no one doing the first thing about
m04-100-01 it . " Stung , the conductor was . " What you
m04-100-02 expect me to do ? " he inquired , bitter .
m04-100-03 " Radio Flying Control at London Airport ,
m04-100-04 is it ? " " Mutual recriminations will get
m04-100-05 us nowhere , " boomed the Rev. Edwards .
m04-100-06 " It 's all very well , " commented
m04-100-07 Mr. Hayball from the back seat .
m04-107-00 " But Eth and me wanted to be
m04-107-01 at the Youth Hostel before dark . "
m04-107-02 Morfydd Owen was silent . But she
m04-107-03 looked down at the fast-disappearing
m04-107-04 earth , and it seemed to her that she
m04-107-05 would never see her Dai again . And
m04-107-06 though half an hour ago she had
m04-107-07 regarded this possibility with
m04-107-08 fortitude , it now filled her with
m04-107-09 dismay . Quietly she began to
m04-107-10 weep ...
m04-113-00 Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling
m04-113-01 furiously on the road . Not a sign of
m04-113-02 the bus . He passed The Traveller's
m04-113-03 Joy . At last he caught up Mr. Roberts ,
m04-113-04 walking very dogged towards Llangrwl .
m04-113-05 " Afternoon , Mr. Roberts , " he called , polite ,
m04-113-06 as he shot past . His spirits were rising .
m04-113-07 He had seen no sign of an accident .
m04-113-08 Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken .
m04-113-09 He would find the bus safe and sound in
m04-113-10 Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly
m04-123-00 But disappointment awaited him . A
m04-123-01 restive queue of people in the bus station ,
m04-123-02 waiting to be transported to Dinas . And
m04-123-03 when he went to Morfydd's house , all
m04-123-04 he found was Morfydd's mam , working
m04-123-05 herself up proper ... Getting dark , now .
m04-123-06 The conductor switched on the lights .
m04-123-07 The beleaguered passengers peered out of
m04-123-08 the windows . Little to be seen , only a
m04-123-09 few lone stars , and the distant earth
m04-123-10 brooding in her shroud of mist .
m04-131-00 Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped , nursing
m04-131-01 the sleeping Cadwallader . Driver and
m04-131-02 conductor peered ahead into nothingness .
m04-131-03 On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
m04-131-04 his Eth . Morfydd thought of Dai . The
m04-131-05 Rev. Edwards , standing at the front ,
m04-131-06 looked at his forlorn flock . " What
m04-131-07 about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda ? "
m04-131-08 he suggested hopefully .
m04-138-00 They looked at him , sullen . His heart
m04-138-01 sank . If the Welsh found the situation
m04-138-02 too desperate for singing , then the
m04-138-03 situation , he realised , must be desperate
m04-138-04 indeed . But suddenly they were roused
m04-138-05 from their lethargy . Something was
m04-138-06 approaching , faster , faster , a tearing
m04-138-07 hurrying blur that was past and gone
m04-138-08 in a moment , followed by a great
m04-138-09 rush of sound . They waved frantically .
m04-231-00 " Do as I say , driver . " Very stern , the reverend
m04-231-01 gentleman was . So the driver peep-peeped as
m04-231-02 through empty space . " Thank you , " the Rev.
m04-231-03 Edwards said courteously . " Secondly , we must
m04-231-04 pool and ration our supplies of food , if any . "
m04-231-05 He looked at Price the Provisions , who was nursing
m04-231-06 a great basket .
m04-238-00 " Now , who has any food ? " he asked hopefully .
m04-238-01 Stared back did Price the Provisions , unwinking .
m04-238-02 " Mr. Price , I think you may be able to help us here , "
m04-238-03 said the Rev. Edwards . Price shook his head .
m04-238-04 " Intended for Plas Newydd , this lot is . Paid for ,
m04-238-05 too . " He folded his arms protectively over the basket .
m04-246-00 Mutinous dog , thought the Rev. Edwards , who hadn't
m04-246-01 enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
m04-246-02 Island . " What have you got in that basket , Price ? "
m04-246-03 he roared . Quelled , Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
m04-246-04 list , pushed his glasses up on his nose , and
m04-246-05 began to read . " Six loaves , four pounds butter ,
m04-246-06 two pounds marge , one tin pineapple , one York ham . "
m06-031-00 ' But we - ' ' Stop your stupid talk , woman ! ' ' We are - '
m06-031-01 ' Be silent , woman , and listen , ' Band Appa Bondi said .
m06-031-02 ' We know much , ' repeated the Chief Captive . ' Some
m06-031-03 things we will tell you . All who make the journey from
m06-031-04 the Heavy World become changed . Some die . Most live
m06-031-05 and grow wings . Between the worlds are many strong
m06-031-06 rays , not seen or felt , which change our bodies .
m06-042-00 When you come here , when you come to the True
m06-042-01 World , you become a true human . The grub of the
m06-042-02 tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes . So humans
m06-042-03 change . ' ' I cannot know what he says , ' Haris said
m06-042-04 stubbornly , throwing himself down . But Lily-yo and
m06-042-05 Flor were listening .
m06-048-00 ' To this True World , as you call it , we come to die , '
m06-048-01 Lily-yo said , doubtingly . The Captive with the
m06-048-02 fleshless jaw said , ' The grub of the tigerfly thinks
m06-048-03 it dies when it changes into a tigerfly . ' ' You are still
m06-048-04 young , ' said the Chief Captive . ' You begin newly here .
m06-048-05 Where are your souls ? ' Lily-yo and Flor looked at
m06-048-06 each other . In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
m06-048-07 heedlessly thrown down their souls .
m06-056-00 Haris had trampled on his . It was unthinkable !
m06-056-01 ' You see . You needed them no more . You are still
m06-056-02 young . You may be able to have babies . Some of those
m06-056-03 babies may be born with wings . ' The Captive with
m06-056-04 the boneless arms added , ' Some may be born wrong ,
m06-056-05 as we are . Some may be born right . '
m06-067-00 ' You are too foul to live ! ' Haris growled . ' Why are
m06-067-01 you not killed ? ' ' Because we know all things , ' the
m06-067-02 Chief Captive said . Suddenly his second head roused
m06-067-03 itself and declared , ' To be a good shape is not all
m06-067-04 in life . To know is also good . Because we cannot move
m06-067-05 well we can - think . This tribe of the True World
m06-067-06 is good and knows these things .
m06-076-00 So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo
m06-076-01 muttered together . ' Do you say that you poor
m06-076-02 Captives rule the True World ? ' Lily-yo asked
m06-076-03 at last . ' We do . ' ' Then why are you captives ? '
m06-076-04 The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected ,
m06-076-05 making his perpetual little gesture of protest ,
m06-076-06 spoke for the first time .
m06-083-00 ' To rule is to serve , woman . Those who bear power
m06-083-01 are slaves to it . Only an outcast is free . Because
m06-083-02 we are Captives , we have the time to talk and
m06-083-03 think and plan and know . Those who know
m06-083-04 command the knives of others . ' ' No hurt will
m06-083-05 come to you , Lily-yo , ' Band Appa Bondi added .
m06-083-06 ' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
m06-083-07 from harm . '
m06-091-00 ' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths .
m06-091-01 ' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion
m06-091-02 Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
m06-091-03 must help our great plan . ' ' The invasion ? ' Bondi
m06-091-04 asked . ' What else ? Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive
m06-091-05 here at a good time . Memories of the Heavy World
m06-091-06 and its savage life are still fresh in you .
m06-098-00 We need such memories . So we ask you to go
m06-098-01 back there on a great plan we have . ' ' Go back ? '
m06-098-02 gasped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy
m06-098-03 World . You must help to lead our force . ' The long
m06-098-04 afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road
m06-098-05 of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
m06-098-06 everlasting night .
m06-106-00 Motion there was , but motion without event - except
m06-106-01 for those negligible events that seemed so large to
m06-106-02 the creatures participating in them . For Lily-yo , Flor
m06-106-03 and Haris there were many events . Chief of these was
m06-106-04 that they learned to fly properly . The pains associated
m06-106-05 with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
m06-106-06 new flesh and tendon strengthened . To sail up in the
m06-106-07 light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
m06-106-08 flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
m06-106-09 had no place here .
n01-000-00 Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
n01-000-01 been inclined to regard women as something
n01-000-02 which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01-000-03 career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01-000-04 his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl
n01-000-05 whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01-000-06 than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01-000-07 prepared to place complete reliance .
n01-004-00 It was a novel experience . Alastair was
n01-004-01 quite unable to explain why he should feel
n01-004-02 so much confidence in her . Once again
n01-004-03 she checked back her instructions . It was
n01-004-04 obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
n01-004-05 faith which he was placing in her and
n01-004-06 was prepared to accept the responsibility .
n01-009-00 " Good luck , Air Marshal , " she said gently . " I 'll
n01-009-01 be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
n01-009-02 evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01-009-03 both at midnight . " They might have been
n01-009-04 arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
n01-009-05 Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01-009-06 uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01-009-07 sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01-009-08 efficient .
n01-020-00 For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01-020-01 to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
n01-020-02 physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01-020-03 gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
n01-020-04 capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles
n01-020-05 below , was not recognisable among the host
n01-020-06 of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
n01-020-07 radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
n01-020-08 flickered across its surface , but there was
n01-020-09 no permanent image .
n01-031-00 In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01-031-01 make a direct comparison between the radar
n01-031-02 image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
n01-031-03 Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
n01-031-04 left , Milan . The directional angle of the
n01-031-05 scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01-031-06 particular area within its range . Geoffrey
n01-031-07 turned the scale slowly to cover the
n01-031-08 ground immediately ahead .
n01-036-00 He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the
n01-036-01 naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even
n01-036-02 on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
n01-036-03 at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
n01-036-04 the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
n01-036-05 was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
n01-045-00 Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
n01-045-01 pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01-045-02 dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
n01-045-03 recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0
n01-045-04 before coming to rest at 5.0 . " We 're a bit
n01-045-05 ahead of time , " said Alastair . " We 'll run
n01-045-06 in on minimum engine power . " Geoffrey
n01-045-07 smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
n01-045-08 they were still more than four hundred
n01-045-09 miles from their destination .
n01-052-00 They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
n01-052-01 on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port .
n01-052-02 He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
n01-052-03 thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,
n01-052-04 along which he had motored so desperately little
n01-052-05 more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then
n01-052-06 he had flown to England , attended the vital
n01-052-07 conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked
n01-052-08 by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
n01-052-09 Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed
n01-052-10 refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
n01-052-11 of the journey back to the place where every
n01-052-12 indication pointed to Eve being held .
n01-057-00 Geoffrey set himself to consider the
n01-057-01 movements of the Bentley . It had passed
n01-057-02 him at the temporary bridge over the
n01-057-03 Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
n01-057-04 previous night . He worked out the distance
n01-057-05 on the presumption that its route had been
n01-057-06 through Florence and Rome and then
n01-057-07 across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
n01-057-08 It came to just over six hundred
n01-057-09 miles .
n02-004-00 To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
n02-004-01 vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
n02-004-02 reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
n02-004-03 But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02-004-04 was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
n02-004-05 He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
n02-004-06 own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
n02-004-07 asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02-004-08 to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
n02-009-00 " I caught him just as he was going to the
n02-009-01 airport to meet Blanche , " he said . " As a matter
n02-009-02 of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
n02-009-03 for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party
n02-009-04 too . They 're both here . " " I didn't know she was
n02-009-05 coming back from Barbados so soon . " Beryl
n02-009-06 said the first thing that came into her head .
n02-028-00 Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to
n02-028-01 express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
n02-028-02 of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl
n02-028-03 suggested having a second party , the following week , he
n02-028-04 poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared ,
n02-028-05 had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them
n02-028-06 nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile
n02-028-07 Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
n02-028-08 earned gratuity to his native village at the
n02-028-09 north of the island .
n02-033-00 It was all over and done with .
n02-033-01 For the time being Beryl was content to let
n02-033-02 it go at that , but she resolved to have
n02-033-03 it out with Piers when a reasonable
n02-033-04 opportunity presented itself . He must
n02-033-05 learn that he could not treat her
n02-033-06 with injustice and contempt , ignoring
n02-033-07 her explanations as though he were
n02-033-08 a schoolmaster and she a small ,
n02-033-09 ignorant child .
n02-037-00 He gave her no chance of any private
n02-037-01 conversation that evening , for when
n02-037-02 Blanche and Jack left , he went with
n02-037-03 them . But next morning she insisted
n02-037-04 on his taking her out in the jeep -
n02-037-05 to find , if possible , Hubert and his
n02-037-06 relations , and tell them of
n02-037-07 her great disappointment at being
n02-037-08 held up in Balicou .
n02-040-00 With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his
n02-040-01 Boxer , to the back , and made room for her
n02-040-02 beside him . " Is that all you want to do ? "
n02-040-03 he asked , letting in the clutch . " No ; I want
n02-040-04 to make you understand just what happened
n02-040-05 about this Balicou trip , " she returned
n02-040-06 coldly . " I 'm a little tired of being treated
n02-040-07 like an ineffective imbecile . "
n02-045-00 " And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called
n02-045-01 to account for my manners , " he retorted .
n02-045-02 " What have I done wrong now ? I cover up for
n02-045-03 you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
n02-045-04 to make the presentation , I run the damned
n02-045-05 party to the best of my ability - saying the
n02-045-06 sugary things you ought to have been there
n02-045-07 to say - and all you can do is to find
n02-045-08 fault . "
n02-049-00 " It 's your superior attitude that riles me . " Beryl was
n02-049-01 scarlet with annoyance . " How I happened to be marooned
n02-049-02 at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree . You
n02-049-03 look as though it was only what you expected of me ,
n02-049-04 as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
n02-049-05 and his pals down . "
n02-054-00 " As your employee it 's not my business
n02-054-01 to understand all the whys and
n02-054-02 wherefores of your actions , " he said
n02-054-03 stiffly . " Still less to criticise you . "
n02-054-04 " Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !
n02-054-05 Be yourself , " she exclaimed , with
n02-054-06 mounting exasperation . " Very well ! " He
n02-054-07 brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
n02-054-08 path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
n02-054-09 " If you want my true opinion I 'll give it .
n02-062-00 You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .
n02-062-01 I 'll give you credit for that . But you didn't press
n02-062-02 the matter because , very naturally , you were
n02-062-03 thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
n02-062-04 idyllic surroundings . " " How dare you say
n02-062-05 such a thing ? " she blazed . " For goodness'
n02-062-06 sake show a glimmer of reason , " was his
n02-062-07 equally indignant rejoinder .
n02-104-00 " I know . Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want
n02-104-01 you to think badly of me . " She turned away
n02-104-02 from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something
n02-104-03 amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to
n02-104-04 gain her attention . " The truth is that
n02-104-05 if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
n02-104-06 time originally arranged , Sir John would
n02-104-07 have had it in for Guy .
n02-109-00 You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake
n02-109-01 on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
n02-109-02 flamingoes our first morning on the island . "
n02-109-03 " What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
n02-109-04 through Sir John's nonsense ? " Piers could
n02-109-05 hardly have spoken with more contempt .
n02-109-06 A bully like that respects anyone who
n02-109-07 dares to stand up to him . "
n02-114-00 Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
n02-114-01 precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
n02-114-02 She said icily , " As you pride yourself on
n02-114-03 your knowledge of all the affairs of the
n02-114-04 island I needn't tell you that Sir John
n02-114-05 Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
n02-114-06 important customers . " " So what ? You 're not
n02-114-07 trying to say that Hewson would victimise
n02-114-08 Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
n02-114-09 courage !
n02-120-00 He 's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
n02-120-01 himself and his business to an unmention-
n02-120-02 able destination . " " There 's a difference
n02-120-03 between what a senior and a junior
n02-120-04 partner can do , " was her quick reply .
n02-120-05 " What they can bring off ! I 'll admit that .
n02-120-06 But Forrest might at least have tried . He 's
n02-120-07 pretty spineless ! "
n02-127-00 " You think you could have carried more weight
n02-127-01 with Sir John ? " she enquired cuttingly .
n02-127-02 " For all your good opinion of yourself ,
n02-127-03 I doubt it . He 's about as easy to push around
n02-127-04 as - as a grounded whale ! " He had to smile
n02-127-05 at that , but went on airily , " I 'd have made
n02-127-06 an attempt to show my lady-love that I
n02-127-07 put her interests before my own .
n02-151-00 Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
n02-151-01 to have been guests at yesterday's
n02-151-02 celebrations , and their friendly welcome
n02-151-03 and warm sympathy , as she explained
n02-151-04 how she had come to miss the party ,
n02-151-05 made her send a complacent glance
n02-151-06 in Piers' direction . What a fuss-box the
n02-151-07 man was , she thought impatiently ,
n02-151-08 trying to worry her into the belief
n02-151-09 that her failure to appear at a function
n02-151-10 on the estate was a major error :
n02-154-00 And then she received a jolt . Old Hubert , standing
n02-154-01 beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his
n02-154-02 toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her
n02-154-03 in halting 6patois that " 3Mistah Piers " had
n02-154-04 explained right at the start that " 3Mis' Beryl "
n02-154-05 would be 3" plenty , plenty sad " not to be back
n02-154-06 at the Villa in time .
n02-157-00 That it wouldn't be her fault at all . That
n02-157-01 she was a lady who , like her Uncle Charles ,
n02-157-02 took the highest pride in keeping her word . " I
n02-157-03 could see 3anudder 3t'ing , " he went on in a
n02-157-04 lower voice , his sunken black eyes twinkling .
n02-157-05 3" He powerful anxious , poor Mistah Piers .
n02-157-06 We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
n02-157-07 to all kin' o' boats , wid d'ose big , big
n02-157-08 rocks in an' out o' de water .
n03-038-00 He had almost entirely settled back into his old
n03-038-01 ways , even to reading law about two hours each
n03-038-02 day . Though he did not refuse wine , which the
n03-038-03 judge always had on the table at dinner , he
n03-038-04 did not act as though he found it necessary
n03-038-05 except in moderate compliance with his father's
n03-038-06 habit .
n03-064-00 Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
n03-064-01 white spray could be seen flying across the distance
n03-064-02 of a mile and a half , came the yawl under her full
n03-064-03 triangular sail , and to the judge's frightened eyes , so
n03-064-04 close to the rocks that it would be dashed
n03-064-05 against them with the lift of the next wave .
n03-066-00 " That boy ! That damned fool boy ! What does he mean
n03-066-01 by trying to come home now , even if he did promise ?
n03-066-02 What does time mean when weighed against the life of
n03-066-03 two human beings ? " Not until he was certain that the
n03-066-04 yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
n03-066-05 being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
n03-066-06 empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
n03-066-07 with part of that howling northwest gale .
n03-097-00 " My God ! " the judge cried out . " The boy
n03-097-01 is going to try to make a landing on the
n03-097-02 weather side of that pier ! He 'll wreck ! "
n03-097-03 Willie Kim was speechless , only his slant
n03-097-04 black eyes showing any emotion . With a
n03-097-05 quick shift of tiller , and at the same time
n03-097-06 jibbing the boom to which he had the
n03-097-07 stay rope fastened , Bill made the
n03-097-08 yawl recover .
n03-103-00 It seemed to the frightened judge
n03-103-01 as though his son would actually
n03-103-02 shoot the craft in under the outer
n03-103-03 end of the wharf . But by pressing
n03-103-04 the tiller hard over and at the
n03-103-05 same time dropping the small sheet
n03-103-06 of wet canvas , Bill cleared the
n03-103-07 corner of the pier by inches , and
n03-103-08 with the tiller still hard over , brought
n03-103-09 the yawl up against the waves
n03-106-00 " Willie , " the judge said huskily ,
n03-106-01 " that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
n03-106-02 hip as I ever saw . That boy of
n03-106-03 mine seems to know how to do
n03-106-04 everything , when he wants to . "
n03-106-05 " 3Naw , " disputed Willie . 3" Just
n03-106-06 play in damn fine luck this time .
n03-106-07 He plenty smart though . " As they
n03-106-08 reached the pier , the judge on legs
n03-106-09 that were a little unsteady , they
n03-106-10 found Bueno Buck , now on the
n03-106-11 pier , leading the yawl toward
n03-113-00 " Hello , Dad ! " Bill called . " I hope you
n03-113-01 weren't worried . We 're going to
n03-113-02 drag the boat ashore and turn
n03-113-03 her over . She has a foot of
n03-113-04 water in her . I wouldn't be
n03-113-05 surprised if we broke all
n03-113-06 speed records on the way in .
n03-113-07 Yes sir , I am slightly wet , and
n03-113-08 Buck would be wetter if he
n03-113-09 had more clothes on . "
n03-120-00 With four doing the job and the waves
n03-120-01 pushing at the stern , the yawl was soon
n03-120-02 dragged out but before it was turned
n03-120-03 over Bueno Buck reached into the foot
n03-120-04 of water , tossed out a string of silvery
n03-120-05 lake trout and said - 3" Bill , he 's better
n03-120-06 man at catch 'em than Injun , Judge .
n03-120-07 You look . Little one more as fifteen
n03-120-08 inches . Maybe big one four feet ,
n03-120-09 huh ? "
n03-126-00 " By George , that is a beautiful string of fish ! "
n03-126-01 exclaimed the judge . " Toss them on the grass
n03-126-02 and then we 'll all get hold and heave . " A
n03-126-03 few moments later the yawl was upside
n03-126-04 down , exposing its shallow keel .
n04-000-00 Bertram's face was grim . " You think it was the Snort ,
n04-000-01 don't you ? " John gave a short laugh . " I did , " he
n04-000-02 said ; " but I 'd better stop thinking that now .
n04-000-03 Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one . "
n04-000-04 " So there you are , my dear . " Peggy 's eyes filled
n04-000-05 with tears . " It 's so unfair , " she said .
n04-009-00 " That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
n04-009-01 months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
n04-009-02 dockyard and now that she 's ready for sea he goes
n04-009-03 sick . Just because he 's an Honourable he can do
n04-009-04 what he likes . Anyway , why pick on you to succeed
n04-009-05 him ? " John didn't answer . There was no point
n04-009-06 in sharing his discomfort with Peggy .
n04-048-00 So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head , that
n04-048-01 famous Portsmouth hostelry , second only in historic
n04-048-02 interest to The George , unhappily destroyed by German
n04-048-03 bombs during the last war . Having deposited his
n04-048-04 baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
n04-048-05 went in search of a drink . The lower bar was
n04-048-06 empty , save for the lady known by all habitue
n04-048-07 *?2s as ' Seaweed ' , and a youngish , sharp-eyed
n04-048-08 man who was staring moodily into a gin
n04-048-09 and tonic .
n04-052-00 Seaweed's memory was prodigious ; her manner
n04-052-01 must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
n04-052-02 of the hotel . She greeted John , however , with less
n04-052-03 than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
n04-052-04 glance at him . Evidently the other occupant
n04-052-05 of the bar was not 6persona grata . If her
n04-052-06 memory was good , so was this stranger's .
n04-052-07 " You 're Commander Winter , " he said . " Have a
n04-052-08 gin ? " He turned to Seaweed -
n04-060-00 " Make it a large one , darling . I know the naval
n04-060-01 habits . ' Drink gin and call each other wallahs ,
n04-060-02 what ! ' - as the Guards officer said on his return
n04-060-03 from a visit to the Royal Navy . Submarines , what .
n04-060-04 Youngest D.S.C. in the war , what ? Crawled
n04-060-05 inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
n04-060-06 bomb . Should have been a V.C.
n04-068-00 What are you waiting for , darling ? The officer is
n04-068-01 obviously thirsty . " John fought back his
n04-068-02 inherited desire to snub the man . If he did he
n04-068-03 would have to leave the bar and either sit in
n04-068-04 the lounge or return to his bedroom .
n04-068-05 Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
n04-068-06 came to the rescue . " You haven't introduced
n04-068-07 yourself , " she said with mock severity .
n04-075-00 " It 's a rule on these premises . No treating with
n04-075-01 strangers - that 's right , John , isn't it ? " " My
n04-075-02 fault entirely , " said the stranger . " It 's my conceited
n04-075-03 nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
n04-075-04 was . I 'm Ian Bawley . Does that mean anything
n04-075-05 to you ? " It did . Ian Bawley's name was
n04-075-06 printed at the head of most naval articles
n04-075-07 in the Daily Courier .
n04-084-00 " Oh , the Press , " said Seaweed . " Down here on business , Mr.
n04-084-01 Bawley ? " " A pressman is always on the job . "
n04-084-02 He held out his hand and John could not do
n04-084-03 otherwise than take it . " Pleased to meet you ,
n04-084-04 Commander , " he said . " Now what about that
n04-084-05 drink ? " John nodded - he could afford to buy
n04-084-06 one in return and he was lonely .
n04-092-00 " For the sake of accuracy , " he said , " and I
n04-092-01 know how you newspaper people value that commodity ! -
n04-092-02 please don't address me as Commander . I 'm
n04-092-03 a Lieutenant-Commander . Perhaps we could
n04-092-04 drop the rank - such a mouthful ! " " You 're
n04-092-05 absolutely right , " said Bawley , as he pushed over
n04-092-06 his glass . " Fill it up , darling . Accuracy above
n04-092-07 all else . We pride ourselves about accuracy on
n04-092-08 the Courier .
n04-100-00 Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service ?
n04-100-01 Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth .
n04-100-02 Somewhat embarrassing , what ? " " How can the
n04-100-03 truth be embarrassing ? " John sipped his double
n04-100-04 gin with relish . It was his favourite brand ,
n04-100-05 he was on the verge of a new chapter in
n04-100-06 his career , and his companion's attitude was
n04-100-07 challenging .
n04-107-00 Life at home and in Bath had been a
n04-107-01 trifle too comfortable and humdrum .
n04-107-02 He 'd never before met a pressman and
n04-107-03 found him curiously stimulating . " You 're a
n04-107-04 bit of a humorist , aren't you ? " said
n04-107-05 Bawley . " The truth is usually very embarra-
n04-107-06 ssing . You 're in submarines , aren't you ? "
n04-107-07 " You know a great deal about me , "
n04-107-08 said John .
n04-114-00 " It 's my business . I 'll tell you more . You 're
n04-114-01 going to take over command of Pericles . Am I
n04-114-02 right ? " " Who told you ? " " Little bird .
n04-114-03 Other half ? " John nodded . " On me . " Bawley
n04-114-04 shook his head . " All paid for by His Lordship , "
n04-114-05 he said . " Expense account . You 're a married
n04-114-06 man with a couple of kids . Can't go wasting
n04-114-07 your substance on a complete stranger . Set
n04-114-08 'em up , darling ! "
n04-130-00 John flushed . " I 'm not in need of charity . " " Come
n04-130-01 off it , " said Bawley . " The proprietor of the Daily
n04-130-02 Courier knows what 's going on . If he doesn't mind ,
n04-130-03 why should you ? " " I see . " John took the
n04-130-04 refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
n04-130-05 companion . " You want me to talk , is that it ? "
n04-139-00 " You misjudge me , " said Bawley . " You have
n04-139-01 nothing to tell me , yet . But we 'll be meeting
n04-139-02 again , no doubt , and then you will have .
n04-139-03 Regard this as a softening-up process , and
n04-139-04 have dinner with me ? On His Lordship ,
n04-139-05 of course . " " On one condition , " said John .
n04-139-06 " Tell me who the little bird was . " " Can't
n04-139-07 you guess ? Whose portrait appears regularly
n04-139-08 in the shiny papers ? "
n04-149-00 " You mean Munyard ? " " Sure . Very useful
n04-149-01 contact , is our Robbie ; he gives us the gen and
n04-149-02 we give him the publicity . ' The Honourable
n04-149-03 " Robbie " and friend ' , what ? You know the
n04-149-04 sort of thing . " " You 'll get nothing out of me , "
n04-149-05 said John , " but you can pay for my drinks
n04-149-06 if you want to , as long as you keep off
n04-149-07 Service matters . "
n04-156-00 " Good-oh ! One for the grill-room , darling , and
n04-156-01 tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour . "
n04-156-02 Bawley was a man of his word . He kept
n04-156-03 away from Service matters , was an excellent
n04-156-04 host and a splendid raconteur . The evening
n04-156-05 passed all too quickly . As they parted in
n04-156-06 the vestibule the two men were well
n04-156-07 disposed towards each other .
n04-163-00 " Ever been to Fleet Street ? " asked Bawley .
n04-163-01 " You should . Next time you 're in Town
n04-163-02 give me a ring at this number and I 'll
n04-163-03 take you round the pubs where most
n04-163-04 of the work is done . " He held out a card .
n04-163-05 John took it and put it in his pocket .
n04-163-06 " Thanks , " he said . " If ever my missus
n04-163-07 lets me off the chain I 'll take you
n04-163-08 up on that .
n04-202-00 Glad I met you . Don't forget to give me a ring -
n04-202-01 any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley , what ? "
n04-202-02 " I don't know when that will be , " said John .
n04-202-03 " I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
n04-202-04 Master bloody Munyard . " THERE were six submarines ,
n04-202-05 lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
n04-202-06 Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
n04-202-07 sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
n04-202-08 charged their electric batteries .
n04-209-00 A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
n04-209-01 through the open windows of the Captain's house . It
n04-209-02 pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
n04-209-03 Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
n04-209-04 a substantial breakfast . Although usually a very
n04-209-05 talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
n04-209-06 silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of
n04-209-07 some sort .
n04-213-00 There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
n04-213-01 affair of Parsifal . Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
n04-213-02 His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,
n04-213-03 but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
n04-213-04 It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
n04-213-05 to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,
n04-213-06 though in peace time these happenings are few and
n04-213-07 far between .
n04-218-00 This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into
n04-218-01 a national disaster and then when it is all over life
n04-218-02 must continue as before . During this period the Captain
n04-218-03 must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
n04-218-04 if nothing unusual has happened . Harry Turton had
n04-218-05 written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the
n04-218-06 locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven
n04-218-07 his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
n04-218-08 usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
n04-218-09 suitable for such occasions .
n06-074-00 He rode down to where I was waiting . I was
n06-074-01 thinking what a skill he had for reading
n06-074-02 my mind . " This would be as good a place
n06-074-03 for a hold-up as any , " he said , reining in
n06-074-04 near me . " Yes , " I said . " It 'll be here to-
n06-074-05 morrow as likely as not . " I paused . " Miss
n06-074-06 Jeannie 'll be on that coach , Dan . "
n06-082-00 " Yes , " he said . " I know . " " No harm must come
n06-082-01 to her , Dan . " " She 'll be all right . It 's the
n06-082-02 men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested
n06-082-03 in , Johnny . " " I know . But if lead starts
n06-082-04 flying she might be in danger . " " That 's so .
n06-082-05 But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at
n06-082-06 us to bother with the coach and the folks
n06-082-07 in it . "
n06-092-00 " Maybe , " I said . " But we 've got to remember
n06-092-01 that girl all the time , Dan . I feel kind
n06-092-02 of responsible for her . " " Of course , " he said ,
n06-092-03 giving me one of his strange looks . Then he
n06-092-04 turned the conversation . " Let 's ride over
n06-092-05 and have a look at the mining camp .
n06-092-06 After all it 's them we 're supposed to be
n06-092-07 working for , as well as the townsfolk and
n06-092-08 the agency detective . "
n06-100-00 With something of a start I remembered the
n06-100-01 man who 'd brought us into this business .
n06-100-02 " Maybe you don't know about Appleton ,
n06-100-03 Dan ? " " Know what ? " " That he 's dead , "
n06-100-04 I said . I watched him because I was always
n06-100-05 fascinated by the way he looked when you
n06-100-06 tried to surprise him . " Dead ? " he said . " Yes .
n06-100-07 Dead . Shuffled out of the deck . Blasted
n06-100-08 down with a shotgun outside the Palace
n06-100-09 last night . "
n06-111-00 " Fenton or Somers , " he said . " Or the Town
n06-111-01 Marshal , " I added . His face was fixed ,
n06-111-02 unreadable as a rock . " Let 's get over to the
n06-111-03 mining camp , " he said abruptly . He wheeled
n06-111-04 his horse back off the trail and up the slope
n06-111-05 leading to the ridge . I followed . From the
n06-111-06 top you could see something of the wild hill
n06-111-07 country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
n06-119-00 The air was fresh and clear and you
n06-119-01 could see far over west and north for many
n06-119-02 miles . The real high country of the Rockies
n06-119-03 lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
n06-119-04 colour drawing . Between us and that lay
n06-119-05 a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
n06-119-06 malpais .
n06-123-00 " The mine-workings lie north of the town , "
n06-123-01 said Dan . " If we head west we ought to
n06-123-02 cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . "
n06-123-03 So we swung west , making slow going over
n06-123-04 rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
n06-123-05 into draws , circling a big mesa by a
n06-123-06 four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . It
n06-123-07 got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
n06-123-08 gratefully by a small creek where we watered
n06-123-09 the horses and drank enough to cure our
n06-123-10 thirst .
n06-128-00 An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
n06-128-01 we figured would lead to the miners' camp .
n06-128-02 We turned north into it and after about four
n06-128-03 miles it led into a small canyon which
n06-128-04 opened out into a wide shallow draw .
n06-128-05 Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
n06-128-06 the miners at work . They were scattered
n06-128-07 over a fairly wide area working singly or
n06-128-08 in pairs .
n06-133-00 We didn't approach unchallenged . Just short
n06-133-01 of the diggings there was a roughly-built
n06-133-02 shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
n06-133-03 out , " If you come any closer , I 'll sure blow
n06-133-04 your whiskers off . " " Take it easy , mister , " I sang
n06-133-05 out . " We don't aim to come any closer and we 've
n06-133-06 got no whiskers so as you can see . Just you
n06-133-07 go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk
n06-133-08 to him about what happened last night . "
n06-140-00 " Oh , " said the unseen guard . He blew a
n06-140-01 whistle then , loud and shrill . The gun barrel
n06-140-02 peeking out through a hole in the shack never
n06-140-03 wavered . We sat our horses , waiting . " Looks as
n06-140-04 though they 're expecting trouble , " I said . " Where
n06-140-05 there 's gold and women there 's always trouble , "
n06-140-06 observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle . He
n06-140-07 was never long on patience .
p01-147-00 Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
p01-147-01 of the church where there was a small open
p01-147-02 outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
p01-147-03 and forks and tidying up implements . It might
p01-147-04 be open . It was . He entered , and seated himself
p01-147-05 in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow .
p01-147-06 His curious headgear fell off . Strange things
p01-147-07 were going on in his bewildered brain . When
p01-147-08 a man was drowning and towards his last
p01-147-09 gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
p01-147-10 life came up before him in some cinematic
p01-147-11 kind of sequence .
p01-155-00 Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
p01-155-01 outbuilding , but this was happening to him now . He
p01-155-02 saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed
p01-155-03 boy , then a young youth . He saw himself refusing
p01-155-04 baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
p01-155-05 Walking out of the chapel later on . Continuing
p01-155-06 on , his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
p01-155-07 canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
p01-155-08 dly decadence and absorption in debase-
p01-155-09 ment and Satanic debauchery .
p01-168-00 He didn't know what to make of it , but it
p01-168-01 was Mr. Copthorne all right . Perhaps he had
p01-168-02 been attending some kind of fancy dress do
p01-168-03 in London . Very strange his eyes looked . Mad ,
p01-168-04 hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
p01-168-05 his head , so the verger described afterwards .
p01-168-06 " You 're very early about , sir , " he said , trying to
p01-168-07 speak normally .
p01-174-00 " Yes . I travelled down from London
p01-174-01 as the dawn was breaking , and
p01-174-02 the thought came to me I 'd like
p01-174-03 to take a look at the church . I 've
p01-174-04 never been inside . Very remiss of
p01-174-05 me , " said Mr. Copthorne . The verger
p01-174-06 led the way in . " The stained glass
p01-174-07 windows , sir , they date back to
p01-174-08 the fourteenth century . "
p02-000-00 There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
p02-000-01 quickly through the customs . " Gay ! " " Gavin ! " The girl
p02-000-02 and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
p02-000-03 together . The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
p02-000-04 taxi . " Just a moment , darling , " Gavin pressed her
p02-000-05 hand and smiled . " I want to check up on the
p02-000-06 flights back . "
p02-008-00 Gay went out to the waiting
p02-008-01 taxi , and then found that in
p02-008-02 the excitement of meeting
p02-008-03 Gavin she had left her sun-
p02-008-04 glasses on the veranda . She
p02-008-05 went quickly back to fetch them .
p02-008-06 Gavin and the girl who had got
p02-008-07 off the plane with him were talking .
p02-008-08 He was writing something in his
p02-008-09 pocket-book , with a sick feeling
p02-008-10 of despair Gay knew that of course
p02-022-00 " And then we 'll go for a stroll along the
p02-022-01 beach . A moon like this mustn't be wasted . "
p02-022-02 He gestured towards the bay where the full
p02-022-03 moon was just rising over the rocks , then
p02-022-04 laid his hand on hers . Gay smiled at him
p02-022-05 again , happy beyond belief , knowing that
p02-022-06 now Gavin was in love with her and her
p02-022-07 only , yet remembering for a second the
p02-022-08 kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
p02-027-00 All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her . She
p02-027-01 would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and
p02-027-02 look the other way if need be . " I say ! " Gavin was looking over her
p02-027-03 shoulder . " That 's a pretty girl ! " Gay glanced behind her , " Isn't she
p02-027-04 lovely , she 's French , a very well known model I believe .
p02-069-00 Gay , a little puzzled , went through
p02-069-01 to the bar . Doc and Lilyan were
p02-069-02 sitting just inside having coffee .
p02-069-03 " Come and join us and bring your
p02-069-04 boy friend , " Doc called . " No , Doc ! "
p02-069-05 Lilyan remonstrated . " They want to be
p02-069-06 alone . " " I 've booked a table at the
p02-069-07 cafe*?2 , " Doc said , " they are packed
p02-069-08 tonight so come and join us if you
p02-069-09 can't find a table for two . "
p02-076-00 Gay thanked him and walked out on to
p02-076-01 the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
p02-076-02 had bought a drink and taken it outside .
p02-076-03 She looked round scanning the tables ,
p02-076-04 then caught her breath , a cold hand
p02-076-05 seeming to clutch her heart . Gavin was
p02-076-06 seated at a small table in a shadowy
p02-076-07 corner talking animatedly to Simone .
p02-076-08 As Gay watched he offered the girl a
p02-076-09 cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
p02-076-10 hers in an intimate way .
p02-081-00 Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
p02-081-01 decided to go back and join Lilyan and
p02-081-02 Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
p02-081-03 run upstairs to her room , knowing that
p02-081-04 Gavin although he had told her that he
p02-081-05 loved her , was already flirting with a girl
p02-081-06 that he had only met a few minutes before .
p02-081-07 Larry's advice flashed through her mind ,
p02-081-08 but she turned away , giving a little
p02-081-09 gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
p02-090-00 The others were all dancing and
p02-090-01 as Gay drew out a chair and sat
p02-090-02 down Gavin , without a word , swept
p02-090-03 Simone on to the floor . " It doesn't mean
p02-090-04 anything , " Gay told herself desperately ,
p02-090-05 trying to understand Gavin's point of
p02-090-06 view and remembering the advice
p02-090-07 that Larry had given her , while she
p02-090-08 felt wretched beyond words .
p02-101-00 His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
p02-101-01 taste but it was unkind beyond words . She fumbled
p02-101-02 with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
p02-101-03 not wanting to smoke but needing some action
p02-101-04 to help her control her feelings . " Come and
p02-101-05 dance , " Doc's cheery voice came as a
p02-101-06 lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana-
p02-101-07 ging a smile .
p02-105-00 As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
p02-105-01 and Simone go through the doorway that led
p02-105-02 down to the beach . Gay closed her eyes for a
p02-105-03 moment in disgust . She was fully aware that Gavin
p02-105-04 would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
p02-105-05 and no doubt he would come back soon and
p02-105-06 after Simone had left expect her to accept his
p02-105-07 kisses on the way back to the hotel .

p02-109-01 -----------------------------------------------------
p02-109-02 " And that 's the man whom you have been eating your
p02-109-03 heart out over ? " Doc nodded towards the door . " You
p02-109-04 may consider him a man , I would say he was a
p02-109-05 mentally adolescent cad . " " Oh , Doc ... " Gay protested
p02-109-06 weakly , " you don't know Gavin . " " I 've only met him
p02-109-07 today but I think I can safely say that I know
p02-109-08 him a great deal better than you do . "
p02-115-00 Doc gave her hand a shake . " Wake up
p02-115-01 Gay , and don't even contemplate throwing
p02-115-02 yourself away on a chap like that . You 're a
p02-115-03 fine girl , intelligent , and pretty , and I had
p02-115-04 thought you were sensible too . Don't
p02-115-05 make a fool of yourself over someone
p02-115-06 who doesn't care two jots for your feelings .
p02-115-07 If he behaves like this now what is your
p02-115-08 married life going to be like ?
p02-135-00 Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
p02-135-01 again Gay found herself alone at the table
p02-135-02 feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that
p02-135-03 people were talking about the way Gavin
p02-135-04 was behaving since they had seen them
p02-135-05 dining together . She opened her bag
p02-135-06 to get out her compact and saw Grace's
p02-135-07 letter . She drew it out and opened it ,
p02-135-08 glad to be able to occupy herself .
p02-139-00 " So glad that you are having such a lovely time , dearie , "
p02-139-01 it ran . " Your cards are lovely . I rang up Miss Harland
p02-139-02 and have been over to sit with her father and do what
p02-139-03 I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping .
p02-139-04 He 's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
p02-139-05 broken arm .
p02-144-00 No other news except that Elaine is engaged
p02-144-01 and going to marry a foreigner ... "
p02-144-02 Gay read the rest of the letter then put
p02-144-03 it back in her bag . Elaine was engaged ,
p02-144-04 to the man she had spent so much time
p02-144-05 with at her party . That was why
p02-144-06 Gavin had come back to her .
p02-144-07 Everything was quite clear now , and to
p02-144-08 her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak ,
p02-144-09 rather a sense of relief now that she
p02-144-10 knew why Gavin had come to see
p02-144-11 her .
p02-150-00 Because she was second best . The others came back
p02-150-01 to the table , all of them making a fuss of her and at once
p02-150-02 she felt happier . Gay loved them for their warm sympathy ,
p02-150-03 knowing that they were real friends , even if they were new ones .
p02-150-04 " That is a pretty dress , " Lilyan commented , obviously sensing
p02-150-05 Gay's distress and in a way that Doc , as a man , could not
p02-150-06 understand , knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
p02-150-07 for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
p02-150-08 was hurt for herself .
p03-012-00 " There are all sorts of wonder-
p03-012-01 ful jobs in London and I could
p03-012-02 take my pick , whereas in Yarmouth
p03-012-03 one has to know something about fishing
p03-012-04 and in Liverpool they 'd want sea-farers .
p03-012-05 I don't think I 'd go to Edinburgh un-
p03-012-06 less I was a Scot and wanting to get
p03-012-07 home , or perhaps a student studying to
p03-012-08 be a doctor , and I already know
p03-012-09 all about that . "
p03-023-00 She was engaged to Nigel , had been for two years .
p03-023-01 Sometimes they talked on the theme of " when we get married " ,
p03-023-02 and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been
p03-023-03 a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last
p03-023-04 evening , " If we get married , old girl , you 'll have to stop
p03-023-05 that lark , I can tell you ! "
p03-027-00 She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
p03-027-01 which ' lark ' she would have to stop , only that significant tiny
p03-027-02 word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
p03-027-03 with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
p03-027-04 which now took on an ominous significance : Nigel had been
p03-027-05 seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
p03-027-06 been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
p03-027-07 Little Phelpham .
p03-029-00 Now Nigel had every right to go where he
p03-029-01 liked during his off-duty periods
p03-029-02 when she was not free ; this much they had
p03-029-03 conceded one to the other . They rarely
p03-029-04 found they were off duty together , and
p03-029-05 the situation would have been intolerable
p03-029-06 had there not been some give and take
p03-029-07 about their relationship . So when Nigel
p03-029-08 had told her about taking Luke's
p03-029-09 evening surgery she had said ,
p03-033-00 " Bless you ! I hope Luke is suitably grateful , darling . " " Oh , well , "
p03-033-01 he shrugged diffidently , " I like the work . One gets plenty
p03-033-02 of variety and it 's a change . " Nigel was the hospital's
p03-033-03 Junior Medical Officer . " You won't be free about nine , I
p03-033-04 suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ? " she had
p03-033-05 asked hopefully .
p03-040-00 " Hardly likely , my sweet . Luke's surgery goes on for
p03-040-01 hours . If they get in before eight-thirty , even
p03-040-02 though they 're standing on one another's toes ,
p03-040-03 I 've got to see 'em . If I am free , though ,
p03-040-04 I 'll give you a ring , O.K. ? " O.K. , " she had
p03-040-05 replied readily . So how could Nigel have
p03-040-06 been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse ,
p03-040-07 dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
p03-040-08 very evening ?
p03-047-00 " No , " she told Phil Gubbins , a junior
p03-047-01 houseman , " it wasn't Nigel you saw ,
p03-047-02 my lad . " " It was Nigel's car , anyway .
p03-047-03 NUF 121 . " " He probably loaned his car
p03-047-04 to somebody , Phil . He 's always doing that . "
p03-047-05 Young Gubbins shrugged . " I didn't see his
p03-047-06 face , Di , but it certainly looked like
p03-047-07 Nigel from the back . D.j. and all .
p03-047-08 Of course such as I couldn't afford
p03-047-09 to go into the Load of Trouble . "
p03-072-00 " 5Ye-es ? " he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
p03-072-01 mouth , an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge .
p03-072-02 " What about it , my sweet ? " " Well , " she laughed
p03-072-03 suddenly in an upsurging of relief , " that stupid
p03-072-04 Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble .
p03-072-05 With a blonde , too . Imagine ! " Nigel was frowning . He
p03-072-06 looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly
p03-072-07 handsome at other times .
p03-080-00 " Gubbins ? Gubbins ? " he fretted . " Who 's he ? "
p03-080-01 Though Diana knew the name of every
p03-080-02 member of the staff , distinguished or not ,
p03-080-03 Nigel often had to think hard to sort
p03-080-04 them out . " He 's the carrotty lad , isn't he ? "
p03-080-05 he now demanded . " What was he
p03-080-06 doing at the Load of Trouble ? "
p03-163-00 " But I want it ! " she protested . " It 's my ring . "
p03-163-01 " You just gave it back to me . " " I
p03-163-02 didn't ! I was joking . You know I was
p03-163-03 joking , Nigel . " " You shouldn't joke
p03-163-04 about serious things like engagements . "
p03-163-05 " Don't be such a baby ! " They were going
p03-163-06 to have an open quarrel
p03-163-07 any minute , and she knew it .
p03-173-00 Almost in desperation she appealed , " Will you meet
p03-173-01 me at the gate , four o'clock tomorrow ? " " Why ? " he
p03-173-02 enquired , combing his thick , tawny hair . " To bring
p03-173-03 me up for tea , of course . I just thought . " " I 'll see , "
p03-173-04 he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
p03-173-05 which really hurt . " Without your ring it 's just like
p03-173-06 kissing somebody else's girl , " he decided wickedly ,
p03-173-07 and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
p03-173-08 receive a sharp slap for his pains .
p03-181-00 " If I were somebody else's girl that 's
p03-181-01 what you 'd get , " she flashed at him , and
p03-181-02 so had left him , on her dignity and not
p03-181-03 seeing the look of admiration and revelation
p03-181-04 which had followed her slim young figure
p03-181-05 out of his sight . " Mine , " Nigel Lester had
p03-181-06 decided with a sigh of satisfaction , and
p03-181-07 then regarded the ring which he retrieved
p03-181-08 from his pocket . " At a price , " he concluded ,
p03-181-09 with some bitterness .

p06-042-01 of Philip lying in the other

p06-058-09 He needed her . She would find
p06-058-10 solace in that fact at least .
p06-069-00 She had her truth . How much had built

p06-069-02 little joy , or satisfaction , it had
p06-069-03 given her . ' I 'm sorry , darling . '
